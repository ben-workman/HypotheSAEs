No surprise..couldn't resist another chance to blame everyone else including Yelp...classy.  But in fairness to your customer, Yelp is not about \"likes,\" it's about reviews and if you're a customer service business and can't break 4 let alone 3 stars (meaning nobody wants to give you positive love) then we both know you have a problem.  Now you're going to blame Yelp???  Wow.  That's a new one.  Look at the other businesses on Yelp.  If you're under 3.0 with 100 plus reviews...you need to be accountable.  Where are your 1 million customers who should be giving you 4 or 5 stars -- I'm sure they've never heard of the Internet? \n\nSo again...You would think Miles would look at their reviews and realize they have some problems.  Recently, our car was hit in their automated wash and they blamed us for not following instructions.  They did so rudely and while screaming at one another in front of their customers.  Then they self righteously said its not their fault even though by their own admission it's happened before and they control the machine.  No safety controls, no liability because they \"say so\" and apparently it's the customer's problem if things go wrong.  Nice.  \n\nThe reason they are crowded is that no one else competes with them because overhead in the area is so high.  But I love the self-righteous review that says Miles is fantastic and you get what you pay for...ok, uh, this place is silly expensive...customers should expect high quality and great customer service for any level of service.  If you disagree don't suggest we are all too dim to understand the concept of \"getting what you pay for.\"  This is not the establishment to make that case.\n\nAll in all, surprisingly mediocre cleaning service and wretched customer service with a ridiculous wait to boot.  Go online and find a mobile service.  No wait and they do a much better job because they get by on word of mouth and reputation not based on exclusivity and a high rent address.","date":1464639632000}

I wasn't sure what to get, and she told of the $5 pork sandwiches, so I got one. Meat wasn't exactly hot, but the flavor was right on, and the sauce was killer.

The rest of the staff was engaging and nice to me. I never ran out of my drink, and the bartender even filled up a fresh to-go cup too.

The spot is casual enough for the daylight and evening hours but, with the table settings, can lend itself nicely to date nights (though the lights are always too-too high). \n\nIt seems to be a good draw for couples and small families. Doesn't seem to get too insanely busy, but does keep a decent stream of customers. \n\nOn the menu (which is fairly small, comparatively), you will find tufahiju, sarmu, pljeskavicu, sarma, sataras, mahune, riza, grasak, baklava and cevape, which are Bosnian ground beef sausages. Smallest order you can get as an adult is 10 -- so come hungry, or ready to share. \n\nHere is my endorsement: get the tzatziki and ajvar and do try the cabbage (dinstani kupus) with butter rice. Good goa! What a perfect combination. \n\nThe tzatziki does not have even the slightest bit of bitterness to it. It is soft, smooth and creamy. \n\nThe ajvar (a roasted red pepper spread with a strong hint of eggplant) is much heavier, and complements the tzatziki quite well. \n\nThe cabbage -- and I do love, love, love cabbage -- was flavored with tomato sauce, carrots, onions and I am not sure what else. So good! \n\nAnd know that the serving sizes are massive. That order alone could have fed two adults, especially when you get extra bread offerings for the tzatziki and ajvar. \n\nAlso, the Alisha family is quite lovely. Beautiful family running a darling business. I felt like I was part of their extended family. True story. \n\nAnd watch out for specials. For example, the most recent one was a special roast lamb dinner at $17, served with potatoes and bread.","date":1444363283000}

Has televisions playing sports, however, so pacers games will not be missed.\nFood and drink: great selection of pizzas. If one is hungry enough, could probably order his\/her own, but in most cases the pizzas are big enough to split between 2. Definitely try their soup of the day (always tasty) or salads to  complement the pizza. As opposed to most pizza, neapolitan style does not carry as heavy of a caloric load, so the guilt of consuming is dampened. The crust is thin, but crust is rolled up along the edges and is still doughy and delicious. Sauce is a bit sweet, but not too much. Meats are locally sourced. Wine selection is extensive, and waitstaff very knowledgeable about wines. Pastas are on the menu as well, though admittedly, I have yet to try in favor of pizza. Great date night.

My friend has already ordered a dozen wings.  We wait to see how these are before proceeding.  We like hot wings and there were a couple things wrong.  Number one, the wings were over cooked.  I mean really dry here.  I like dark meat on chicken\/turkey and these wings could not be saved.  The hot sauce was what would compare to a mild sauce at some other non-wing places.  And the truly hot habanero sauce was vinegar based in a bad way.  I like vinegar based wing sauce but this didn't work.  Especially for a super hot sauce.   \n\nOur daughter and her friends were there as well.  We were their ride.  They tried to pay, each girl had a twenty and the counter would only change out one twenty.  So we scrambled for change.  Irritating. Customer service is not a top priority.\n\nDon't get me started on the Tuesday night wing night rules.................... \n\nSo WOB will not make my top three wing places in Tucson.","date":1380937756000}

I felt the empanada was simply a pocket of grease (yes, I know this is a deep fried cheese appetizer but I've had better from local corner stores in the city). The croquettes were good but not great. I love the croquettes at Amada and was expecting Rosa's to be as enjoyable but there was a sweetness to the dish that wasn't appealing to me, but my fianc\u00e9 seemed to enjoy them.\n\nFor our entrees, I had the ropa vieja and my fianc\u00e9 ordered the Cubano. Both dishes had a substantial flavor profile, but again, we felt as though we'd had better in the city. Visually they were both pretty underwhelming as well.\n\nHowever, I will say that dessert was EPIC! Best dessert I have had in a long time and was much more on a level that I was expecting.

We have been going to Philadelphia for Mexican and always struggle with parking and location and the like. An acquaintance recommended  that we go to to Parrilla la Fogata in Berlin New Jersey. It was in a decrepit old shopping center but we have never allowed the exterior to deter us from trying the food. As someone previously commented we were the only non Mexican people in the restaurant but everyone was friendly and the wait staff spoke fluent English and Spanish and was extremely pleasant and helpful. The tacos at $3 each were an incredible bargain and we were not required to purchase three of the same thing. Guacamole was extremely good and because it was the weekend they gave us complimentary nacho chips covered in refried beans with tomatillo sauce and red salsa pico de gallo and pickled onions. We also got nopales which were grilled and excellent. The portions are extremely large and I had an antojinto, an open face home made tortilla with chorizo and lengua. My wife and daughter each had three tacos. The portions were so large none of us could finish and we brought home a doggy bag. A first for our family. Our waitress turned out to be the daughter of the owners and told us that they are getting ready to move two or three doors down in the same center into a much larger facility.

I've been to Mesh multiple times. There was only one visit where my steak wasn't cooked to order during Devour Downtown, but I have otherwise been happy on the few occasions that I splurged for the filet mignon. It's amazing when cooked right and topped with herb butter, perched atop a bed of mashed potatoes and asparagus. The bread pudding and ice cream are also fantastic. You can tell the food is fresh and expertly prepared. I normally take food to go at most restaurants, who try to make up for their lower quality food by giving you a far larger serving than any one person needs, but I couldn't help shoving the entire 8 ounces of steak into my face during our most recent visit for my friend's bachelorette party leaving just a straw of asparagus. I don't even like asparagus, so the fact I ate one straw felt like a personal victory. We were able to reserve a table of 10 and received excellent service and food.

I really like Historic Hospitality and their restaurants.  Jason Fernandez is all about Tampa, and I've got great respect for him and his vision.  Green Iguana is a great joint with good bar food, Bernini has some of the best Italian grub and pizza around, and while Carne's steaks aren't the best, they have other redeeming menu items and a fantastic bar.  So what the hell is going on at Tequila's???\n\nAfter The Yelpies this year, a group of us opted to remain in Ybor and do a little bar hopping.  Afterwards, we decided to hit up El Puerto, and on the way, we bumped into the two chefs from Tequila's.  Our casual convo on the side of 7th Ave. turned into us having dinner with them.  They told us how Mexican food was their passion, and how big and exciting changes were coming to the menu.  This coupled with the wonderful flautas I had at The Yelpies is what brought me to Tequila's Friday evening.\n\nTried to order flautas.  \"Sorry, we only make those for catering orders.\"  You've gotta be kidding me.  The absolute best taquito I've ever eaten in my life, and part of the reason for me being here is unattainable?  Not a good start.  \n\nMy son ordered the cheesesteak torta, which is made with carne asada and Mexican cheese.  Sounds good, huh?  Well, it was just OK.  Very little flavor where the carne asada was concerned, and it was about the size a McDonald's Quarter Pounder.  Disappointing.\n\nI ordered the fajita burrito.  You know how when someone orders fajitas, all of the meats and veggies are sizzling and the flavors all mix together?  Well, none of that happened with my burrito.  The chicken was luke warm, dry and flavorless, and the veggies were nearly raw.  I'd be willing to bet, they have some pre-cooked and cubed chicken breast sitting in a prep tub and they casually heat it up with some onions and green peppers for this burrito.  And the kicker?  Burrito had rice and beans inside of it, and it is also served with a side of the same rice and beans.  Also, the rice was old and crunchy to boot.  I'm serious when I say I've had better burritos from Taco Bell.\n\nLastly, our waitress was dismissive and distracted.

The ginger was incredibly strong and fresh, the tuna was very fresh too.\n\nThe potato-stuffed ravioli with lamb.  Wow, fantastic flavors, the lamb's sauce was rich and wonderful, the pasta was cooked perfectly, and there were crispy bread crumbs on top that had been cooked in a brown butter sauce.  The lamb was the perfect amount, just a few tastes, and did not overpower the raviolis, it complimented them beautifully.\n\nRomaine salad with cheddar cheese.  Yeah, weird, but it worked.  The cheese was melted, and the romaine was smoked.  There were a few other things in the salad which I couldn't detect, but I only had one bite.\n\nBeef cheeks.  Wow, a beautiful, Asian-tasting broth, scallions, green beans, chick peas, and I think asparagus too.  Cheeks were incredibly tender, melt in your mouth.  (I only had one bite of this one too)\n\nThe desserts were a little disappointing, I had a smoky toasty bread thing with peaches on it, but the peaches were cooked in such a way as to remind me of canned peaches.\n\nService was perfect, and the people here all seemed hip.

Red Robin has dropped the ball on this one.\n\nAfter a late session of retail therapy, my wife decided we should have a burger for dinner. \"Fine\" said I, and began consulting Yelp for a Five Guys. Just then we passed Red Robin, and as neither or us had ever been to this particular house of yum before, we decided to give it a go.\n\nIn we went. Were met by a nice young bloke, then we went to a booth in the bar area and sat down. We were in a bar, so its no surprise that it stank like a bar. We were met by a pleasant lady who asked if we would like a drink. \"Yes please\" we intoned. I wanted a non-alcoholic beer and my wife wanted iced tea. Well, there was no N\/A beer (out of stock) so I decided to have a coffee. I was then told, by a staff member, that I didn't want coffee because their brew is bloody horrible.\n\nI opted for a Michelob Ultra. Anyone who has worked in a bar will know that if a glass isn't properly cleaned, especially if the glass has held a milk or 'thick' drink, the beer that is poured into it, will not develop a head. So, one headless, slightly flattish beer for Dave!\n\nWe then ordered 'gourmet' burgers. I had the chicken teriyaki job, my wife had their special cheese burger. The filling in mine was very nice. My wife says hers was ordinary at best. We both thought the buns were awful. Maybe not stale, but certainly they had been frozen and had been thawed 'for-a-while'. My fries were very good, my wife ordered broccoli which she said was old and inedible.\n\nSo, that little mess cost us $30 (not including tip). Maccas would have been better! There was nothing gourmet about the food we ate tonight, except for the price. There is a whole lot of competition, in any population center, for good burgers served in a pleasant environment. Red Robin, it appears to me, is not in the race. \n\nVery disappointing.","date":1531712342000}

I opted for their new Mediterranean Chicken (they revamped their menu within the last few months and added some EXCELLENT options).\n\nThe Mediterranean Chicken came with a finely spiced chicken, naan bread, cucumber yogurt, and asparagus. For $15.95, I was extremely pleased with what was placed on my table. \n\nSomehow, we saved enough room for dessert and decided to go with our favorite: The Flourless Chocolate Torte. I've searched far and wide for a competitor with this specific torte, and nothing even comes close. It comes with the same raspberry coulis as the Brie (ask for extra coulis).

Their chicken sandwich is pretty darn good.  And if you want some sides, their tater tots get high marks, and their quinoa salad is also really tasty with nice cooked vegetables in there.  Additionally, the Great Full Burger is alright, and you do get a lot of really good options for breads, sauces, additional toppings, etc.  Their house made salad dressing was pretty nice, and their tomato soup was most excellent, crafted as it was by Gino the Soup Man.\n\nThe service here was very courteous, and the staff have a great fun attitude that I really appreciate.  If you are a walk-up customer, your orders might take a little longer compared to other fast food, food court sort of stalls.

After a little over a month of being open, I'd say they are on their way to something awesome. Dan, our bartender knew tons of info on tequila (and all the other liquor they had). The lovely tatted barmaid concocted a \"bartender's choice\" beverage - with tequila, of course. The other servers seemed friendly. Everyone was making friends at the bar. Good feeling all around.\n\nAs far as food is concerned: definitely a different kind of salsa. Nice and mellow - little bit of smokiness to it. Fresh chips (had to add salt), nice and crunchy. Home made for sure.\n\nEnchilladas are the way to go. REAL CHICKEN!!! Same goes for the chicken burrito.Not the shredded stuff, mind you, but great cubed chicken breast. It may seem pricey, but you pay for what you get! Jicama Salad was fresh and light. \n\nAnd of course the margarita was stellar. Tart and boozy.

A $45 dinner for two. Oh em gee, I can't wait to come back. My friend and I shared the flautas de pollo. We each got an enchilada, she got chicken, and I got the mixtas (steak, pork, chicken), side of corn and tamale. And then of course we shared the tres leches! \nSo much food, and so well done. The chicken flautas were crispy on the outside and soft fall apart shredded chicken with delicious sauce and crispy red cabbage. The enchiladas were definitely fresh, and the pork\/sausage was very well seasoned, I really recommend the enchilada mixtas, my friend liked her chicken enchilada! \nNothing special I feel like a bout their side corn dish, looked like a lot of seasonings on it, but it didn't really taste like anything memorable. \nSo, side note, before I rave about their tamale, every Hispanic culture does tamales differently, and this is what I would consider a true typical tamale. You can taste the corn and seasonings. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to taste what a real tamale is supposed to be like (that is of Mexican culture). \nLoved the tres leches, definitely get it! \nOverall, I think our service was good, for the first day of tamp bay restaurant week She knew the menu well and was able to inform us of spicy-level and what was in each meal. \nAlso, surprise, their meals come with free chips and salsa, and this particular dinner comes with a bowl of rice and beans to share!","date":1529405532000}

I easily flagged down one of the servers and they couldn't of been more understanding. It wasn't too big of a deal as they eventually asked if I wanted to try anything else.

We stopped for lunch and we were surprised by how old-school it was inside. \n\nAfter studying the menu at length, we finally settled on sharing an antipasto, I ordered the eggplant Parmesan,and my boyfriend ordered the sausage grinder. The server suggested the small antipasto since we were ordering other food and she was right! It had a nice variety of meat and cheese rolled up and sliced with olives, tomato, cucumber, red onion, pepperoncini, and salami on a bed of fresh crisp lettuce. The dressing came on the side and it was delicious. We were asked if we would like garlic bread or plain bread with the antipasto and we chose garlic. It was crisp yet soft enough to eat without breaking apart. The garlic butter on top was perfectly seasoned and it was just the right amount. I could have made the bread and salad my lunch and stopped there. We took half of it back to our rental.\n\nThe eggplant parmesan came in an oval metal dish and it was a bubbly, melted combination of eggplant, marinara sauce, and cheeses. I make a great eggplant parmesan myself and I was delighted with Gennaro's. The eggplant wasn't overly breaded so the eggplant flavor shone through the sauce and the cheeses. It was cooked perfectly and although I was stuffed, I finished it. My boyfriend likes eggplant parmesan but he loved that version.\n\nThe sausage grinder was huge! It was fresh baked bread (baked there) with a generous portion of lean and perfectly cooked sausage covered with marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese. It tasted like there was parmesan in there as well. It was heavenly. My boyfriend had more restraint and he only at half of it, but enjoyed the other half for breakfast the next day.\n\nThere wasn't anything I didn't love about our lunch there. If we had stayed in St. Pete Beach longer we would have had dinner there since the dinner menu looks just as enticing. I have no doubt we will be back.","date":1471355497000}

Not only do they offer it in a glass bottle (along with alot of other gourmet sodas) but they also have it on tap at a self-serve soda fountain so you can drink it to your heart's content. And it's true what they say about Cheerwine going perfectly with BBQ. It enhances the taste. But there are other things to be cheery about as well...THE FOOD at 4 Rivers! Wow!! I loved it all!!! Especially the GREEN BEANS...They are out of this world! Better than any that my Southern relatives used to make in North Carolina. Better than any I have ever tried at any other restaurant. I could make a whole meal out of their green beans and cornbread. But why stop there...the pulled pork and brisket were awesome and all the other sides that I have tried so far. The stuffed pepper with cream cheese was a taste sensation. The mac and cheese hit the spot. The collard greens were tasty. I can't wait to go back and try all the other mouth-watering sides. In fact I'm glad they offer the smaller sized BBQ sandwiches (on those scrumptious rolls) so you can save room for more of those incredible sides. I am all about the Sides...

I like the shabby chic decor.  My initial intention was to get a cup of coffee and move on, but I was starving!  So I decided to take a look at the brunch menu.  The chicken and egg dish stood out to me so I ordered it.  I ordered the house coffee to go along with it.  Their coffee is from Sumptown coffee roasters out of Brooklyn.  Sumptown is well known among coffee connoisseurs.  I was excited to taste a cup from this artisanal coffee roaster. The coffee was good.  It was not the best drip coffee I ever had, but it was good. \n\nMy entree arrived and it dawned on me that this is a unique twist on chicken and waffles.  The French toast had an egg in the middle of it, which is very creative.  This dish totally blew me away.  My chicken was moist and the exterior was very crunchy.  The French toast was great.  You can't go wrong when you choose Brioche for making French toast. \n\nThe service was good and the staff was friendly.  I found the atmosphere to be a nice place to relax with a cup of coffee.  I really enjoyed the selection of 70's soul music they were playing.  They also sell tea and pastries.  I bought an oatmeal, peanut butter, chocolate chip cookie that was delish.  What else more can one ask for from a coffee shop besides good coffee, good food and good service?  This place has it all.","date":1361672906000}

I have no idea how long it was in the window, but it took her 15 minutes from when I noticed it for her to reappear, without our sushi. When she did, I had to flag her down and point it out to her. When she finally brought it, she dropped the plate in front of me and stormed off and then continued to glare at us from behind the bar. We were dissatisfied, finished our meal, and left asap.\n\nWe decided to give it another chance tonight as our date night. We ordered the all you can eat and a glass of wine and a beer. The waitress was very nice and prompt, and we were having a decent time until about halfway during the meal. I began to feel unwell. Our bill was around 60 with tip. By the time we got in the car, both of us were not feeling well. By the time we were home, we were horribly sick. \n\nAs much as I like food poisoning, I'd rather not get it on date night. We will not be returning.","date":1424336975000}

As others have said, it is old world, romantic, and somehow engenders that rare cozy\/content feeling you get from Thanksgiving dinner (what the Danes would call hygge): just the right amount of light, little candles at each table, vintage strings of lights, citrus and pomegranates growing all around you...it is beautiful and unexpected amidst the hustle, bustle, and grittiness of 4th Ave.\n\nFor the record, the food is fine too.  The salad is above average (good portion size, a little bit of everything nice to include in an Italian salad, and tasty dressing + on a nice oblong metal plate that keeps it chilled), and the entrees I've tried are good (although a little greasy and cheesy for me).\n\nIt seems many of the negative reviewers ordered the veal. Do you know what veal is exactly?\n  I'ma gonna go on a soap-box here and say that maybe your negative experiences are a sign from the universe to stop eating poor, defenseless, tortured young animals.  Anytime I see veal on a menu, I throw up a little in my mouth because it is so disgusting that anyone would go out of their way to eat something that has caused more cruelty than the typical meat dish.  Like, isn't it enough that we factory farm the hell out of most animals?  Do we also have to chain up young cows and not let them move so people can complain about their veal parm at Caruso's and send it back to the kitchen?  It's sick, disgusting, and I really wish people would not order veal. Soap-box done.\n\nCaruso's is wonderful and full of many good memories for me.  Thank you Caruso's!\n\nP.S. Please take veal off your menu--it would probably reduce your negative reviews and send a strong message about animal cruelty.","date":1509248607000}

We both had samples of each other's plates, and we both LOVED what we ordered. The steak was grilled to a perfect medium-rare. The cheese accompaniments and potato were great additions to my plate without overwhelming the star that was the steak. The paella was seasoned just right, and there was a pleasant chewiness to the rice - very reminiscent of a risotto.\n\nThe only thing about Jamonera that was a little upsetting was that the dishes were a little TOO rich... to the point where I had a really upset stomach after dinner.

Wouldn't go back.\n\nThe good:\n\nThe server was extremely friendly and eager to explain the rather complicated process of building your own tacos (you check off a bunch of stuff on a long sheet of paper).\n\nThe queso was pretty good, if a bit salty. Their tortilla chips are quite nicely fried. The pomegranate margarita tasted pretty good as well.\n\nThe not so good:\n\nI didn't find the taco ordering process to be all attractive. I think the big flaw of it is that there is no reason to expect that any combination you can think of will be particularly good. I'd rather have the restaurant put together combinations in which they have confidence and which the kitchen staff make consistently. To be fair, the restaurant does have a menu of taco suggestions, but these didn't really appeal to me.\n\nCreative is great, but for that Bakersfield on Mass Ave or the nearby Sangrita Saloon in Broad Ripple do a better job. (Also, while working in South Bend recently, the tacos at Evil Czech brewery were fantastic and simply blow Condado's completely away. Big with tons of main ingredient, hot, delicious, creative. Go on taco night, Tuesday, and the prices are also amazing.)\n\nWe had three tacos, with the main ingredients being tofu, jackfruit, and pulled pork. The tofu and jackfruit were quite skimpy, so the effect was that of a mostly empty shell with a little of the main ingredient and a bunch of cold toppings on top. Further, neither the jackfruit nor the tofu really impressed me in terms of flavor. Well, there was so little of the jackfruit that there wasn't much to get a taste of in the first place. The tofu was deep-fried chunks, and it was rather hard and chewy. These were, in a word, not good.\n\nDespite being a more expensive ingredient (one would think), the pulled pork was more abundant, but its flavor was extremely bland.\n\nI don't think the concept of the build-your-own taco really works, and the execution was absolutely not there. This restaurant needs to get its act together, or it will end up another casualty of the Strip. Good luck!","date":1554862173000}

However, with that being said I am still a fan of the food as well as the beer. For beer lovers, I would recommend joining the Mug Club-$35 per year gets you 24 oz beers for the price of 16 oz beers-not a bad deal considering their drafts are usually around $6.50 a pint. Each time you visit, you are awarded points Once you reach 300, you can earn a $25 credit reward (don't know how this works exactly-I'm just going off of what a friend told me). \n\nAs far as beer goes, I had the Luca Brasi-a coffee stout, Rising Sun-an IPA made with Japanese hops, and tried The Situation-10% ABV (be careful with this, especially if you order a mug). I liked all of the beers I tried-once again don't know if I would come back too often unless I was part of the Mug Club.\n\nFood was very good-soups, salads, and burgers were all excellent. Every server including the bar tenders were very helpful and attentive even though the place was packed. \n\nSo overall, I probably wouldn't come here too often especially if you are on a budget unless you are a big beer fan and become a Mug Club holder. As another yelper said, the Blue Monkey in nearby Merchantville has a great tap selection and awesome food as well for a tad cheaper. \n\nP.S. They also have a take-out special-$25 for 2 pizzas and a growler of any of their seasonal beers-not a bad deal if you want to have a \"quiet\" night at home.","date":1333400713000}

I guess it must the the fun ambiance with the theme-park atmosphere.  But as far as the food goes, it's nothing all that great.  We waited for about an hour for our table, so I had some high expectations for this place since there were so many people waiting.  I figured I should try their signature steak, so I shared the \"Big Cowboy\" steak which I ordered medium rare.  It was cooked appropriately, but there was not much flavor.  Good thing  they had A1 Steak Sauce at the table.  I happen to really like A1 sauce, but if I want to have a steak that needs steak sauce, then I can make that at home without the long wait.  I wasn't too impressed with the beans and bread either.  The water tasted kinda funny too.  Service was fine, and the ties on the wall were a fun touch.","date":1361482502000}

Today, I was on my way back from an all day meeting when I happened to see a Bagger Dave's on my way through Fishers. I was tired and I was hungry and I was ready for a bit of comfort food on a chilly, rainy day. \n\nLocated in a small strip center, Bagger Dave's is fairly simply decorated in what I might call a bit of an industrial look. It has big screen televisions hanging from the ceiling around the place and there's two dining areas - I at first thought it might be divided by family dining and a bar area, but I saw youngsters right next to the bar so I'm guessing it was really just a decorative choice. \n\nI was in the section by the bar which, in fact, only had one wheelchair accessible table that happened to be right next to the kitchen area. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but on this particular visit I had the joy of hearing lots of chatter and three plates of some type dropped on the floor and rattling around. In other words, the atmosphere left much to be desired. \n\nI did, however, seem to have the freedom to relax in the place and I was comfortably seated at a four-top. Major plus! I kept my meal fairly simple - a Great American Cheeseburger priced at $7.25 plus a side order of Potato Fries for $3.25. I ordered my usual unsweetened iced tea which, I believe, was priced at about $2.75 of $2.95. The entire meal came in at just under $15.00 plus tip. \n\nWhile Bagger Dave's stresses that they serve gourmet burgers and also stresses that they are made from a prime rib recipe. The burger came with a variety of toppings including lettuce, tomato, mustard, mayo, pickles, and the cheese on a toasted sesame seed bun. The concoction altogether was messy but definitely good sandwich that rested well in my stomach without the usual heaviness that often accompanies a serious burger. I ordered it medium well and it was delivered medium well with just a touch of inconsistency.\n\nThe potato fries, while overpriced, do come in a sizable order and are quite tasty and different from fries I've had in other places. While I'm not convinced I actually preferred them over other places, I'm always a fan of something unique. \n\nBagger Dave's also serves up their own line of soft drinks and a bunch of craft beers, though I also found these to be overpriced and opted to not venture near them.\n\nWhile $15 for a meal is out of the range that most folks want to spend for a burger and fries, it should be stressed that Bagger Dave's is located in Fishers, Indiana and in a fairly  higher income area. So, it's not a bad price considering its target population.\n\nMy service was consistently good without being intrusive. I was offered an iced tea to go, a definite plus and admittedly a surprise. \n\nI came away from Bagger Dave's for the most part satisfied with my meal. While it's more than I normally spend for a meal, it was a relaxing and quality meal with good service and a burger I would consider to be slightly above average but certainly not quite as gourmet as is claimed. While this restaurant certainly won't become a destination spot for me, if I'm in the area and in the mood to spoil myself it's a definite option.","date":1413674745000}

La Teresita was founded by the Capdevila family who emigrated from Cuba to the United States in the early 1960s during the first wave of the Freedom Flights to Miami. The family worked hard to start a small, but extremely well-known grocery store in Tampa, and many years later they built the two-story restaurant along Columbus. \n\nThe La Teresita building holds a sit-down restaurant (Capdevila's at La Teresita) with tables and booths on the east side of the building, the cafeteria with the horseshoe-shaped counters on the west side, a separate takeout area, and a banquet hall on the 2nd floor. \n\nI was out running some errands, and so I stopped in for a quick lunch in the cafeteria which is a replica of the original sandwich & coffee shop that began in 1978.  Service is quick, informal, and there are a lot of colorful regulars who chat it up with the servers and their neighbors. My knowledge of cursing in Spanish seems to increase every time that I visit places like this!  : - )\n\nSince I was in a bit of a rush, I ordered a Cuban sandwich and a bowl of Caldo Gallego (Collard Greens soup). The Cuban was made in the traditional way with ham, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard pressed between halves of freshly-baked Cuban bread. This was absolute perfection, and a very tasty lunch.\n\nIf I'm there with company I'll eat in the sit-down restaurant and enjoy the exact same menu, with a more refined crowd. La Teresita has a huge banquet hall for large gathering, plus they do a lot of catering and take out. They also have a separate Tex Mex restaurant, and a spectacular Latin bakery located right next door.\n\nDefinitely a winner, and one of the best Cuban \/ Spanish restaurants in the area.","date":1370021900000}

We ordered Pina Colada's that were terrible - they tasted like a watered-down coconut pie shake with very little flavor rather than a Pina Colada and little or no alcohol in them. But the server never came back to check on us so we just drank them because we were hot, starving and thirsty. Meanwhile the food was delivered. When our server came back we told her we were not happy with the drinks and she sent the manager over and by that time we also had our food which was also terrible. Instead of making it right he argued with me over what constitutes a good Pina Colada and how much he personally loves theirs and how we should not have felt anything with one drink anyway regarding the amount of alcohol used in the drink. \nHis idea of fixing it was to make us more of the same which I had already found out was made from a mix so the new ones were not going to be any different than the first ones! Besides our food had arrived and we wanted to eat, not drink. Regarding the food, two of us shared and split the burger and chicken sliders - the burger sliders were good but the chicken sliders were dry and tasteless. I had to soak them with hot sauce just to eat them. My mother ordered what was supposed to be the best burger on the beach and it was dry and tasteless and quite possibly the worst burger on the beach. She could barely eat it - she kept adding stuff to it to try to make it taste good. The other person in our party ordered the salad with seared tuna which came out tasteless and nearly raw instead of medium so it had to be sent back to have it cooked at which point her salad was gone and only the tuna was left to eat and we had to sit and wait for her to finish it. So we spent about $80 on terrible food and drinks and a ruined occasion.

I have been in Indy visiting her and saw this one reviewed so we figured we would give it a try.  Over all it is a cute place but, parking is nowhere to be found. What it is all street parking and, people have a tendency to speed down the street in that area. This is really bad if you have to cross it to get to and from the restaurant.  My friend ordered the Cheeseburger and I got the BLT that made them famous. The food gets five stars plus in my opinion, I am pretty high maintenance when it comes to trendy cafes especially being from CA.  \n\nWhile the decor was nice the food was excellent but, I have to say that the servers two women (owners?) were sorely lacking in interpersonal skills. I wanted to order an Arnold Palmer (iced tea and lemonade) the waitress abruptly announced \"I have to charge you for both the tea and the lemonade\" I was confused and made it apparent that I was, it was only then did she explain that the lemonade was bottled (which is fine) but I felt she could have been less rude about the explanation.  I let that slide but, what I cannot let slide was that I had ordered the aioli for my order of fries however when the food arrived the aioli appeared to me to have mustard seed in it. I am extremely allergic to mustard and, did not have an Epi Pen with me. When I asked about the dressing expressing my concerns the woman with the shorter hair who (seemed rather disheveled) was extremely rude interrupting me in mid explanation by saying \"Do what?\" When I said I have an anaphylactic allergy to mustard, seemingly annoyed she said \"There is no mustard in there, its black olives and rosemary\" so just to be on the safe side I avoided eating it.\n\nOver all the food is excellent, the clam chowder outstanding as well as the cole slaw but their people skills are sorely lacking. I can accept it may have been an off night and, I am willing to give it another try but if it happens again for the price ($40.00 for two) I may pass on this place going forward. YMMV","date":1396581271000}

We walked up to the hostess stand, and asked for a table for two for lunch. We thought it was strange that the hostess said, \"let me check\" and walked away because there were many empty tables within sight. We saw her talking to another employee and then came back, and said \"I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this but we actually can't serve you because of your tattoos\". My friend (the one with the tattoos) asked if this was a new rule, since she had been there multiple times in the past month. The hostess said no and seemed confused as to why my friend would have been let in before. Mind you, my friends tattoos are artful and colorful, not PRISON or GANG tattoos. The hostess then said, \"uh, let me go check again, maybe since you have been here before I can seat you this time\". At that point we were both disappointed with the lack of service and respect and did not want to eat there.\n\nWe had a lovely lunch at the cute cafe next door. \n\nI couldn't quite shake the experience and really wanted an explanation for what had happened. I called the restaurant the next day and spoke with the owner\/manager. He explained to me in very basic English, as if I was a five year old that my friend had not been discriminated against since the tattoos were her choice. It would only be discrimination if they didn't let her in because of her gender, race etc. Thanks for the lesson in segregation dude. \n\nAnyways, he said the tattoo rule is new because a few weeks ago, someone came in with prison tattoos at night with a ball chain and beat the crap out of an employee. While this is very tragic and I am so sorry for the person that was injured, this is no way has any reflection on my friend. He explained that they cannot let in \"nice people with tattoos and not mean people with tattoos because that would be a form of discrimination\".\n\nMy question to Sandbar: Shouldn't you be less concerned with disrespecting and discluding those with tattoos and more concerned with the fact that people are coming to your restaurant with freaking ball chains on their person?\n\n If I was the owner\/manager of this place, I would beef up security and make sure people aren't bringing lethal weapons into my restaurant and let loyal customers that may or may not have a few tattoos lunch as they wish.\n\nWill never spend my money here or anywhere else that treats loyal customers in this way. YUCK.\n\n\n**EDIT** Just read through some other reviews of this dirty establishment on YELP and noted that others have had problems dining here due to tattoos also. Funny that the manager told me this is a new rule. At least have the decency to be honest.","date":1378321048000}

Maybe they want you to keep it moving.  So I took my wrap home. I was looking forward to it. And it was horrible!! Why!? It's supposed to be a grilled VEGGIE wrap. There was some spinach or kale in it; the rest was RAW onions, tomatoes, artichokes (yuck, pickled artichokes, they don't go!!) and the sauce. Now every time I ordered this before, it had mushrooms and sauted onions, and other grilled veggies. Why did I get this crap today? And the wrap was so big, half of the filling consisted of it.

I didn't care much for the humus because it was too tart.  I am not a fan of liberal use of lemon juice in Middle Eastern food.  That's not really the restaurant's fault, but rather personal taste.  The platter had lots of food, but not much meat.  There were plenty of rice, pita, and humus to fill you up, but not much chicken.  Further more the chicken was dry.  They used vertical spits to roast the meat.  Its great when a place is busy, but when it is not very busy, the meat is overcooked and dried out.","date":1393992331000}

Be aware that parking in the lot adjacent to the restaurant is at your own risk. Signs clearly state that there's no parking there for Syphay customers. We had no trouble finding a spot elsewhere.

I hadn't been here for a while, so it was good to be back. They are known in the west for serving large portions of American comfort food at reasonable prices, along with having extreme black bear themed restaurants. Even the servers were black bear suspenders at most locations.\n\nParking is a little strange, since the diner abuts South Virginia Street directly, with the entrance being right on the sidewalk just about. There is some parking on either side, but more in the back. However, when I have gone in the past, I have been scared to park in the back, since it was dark and all the stores on that side closed early it seemed.\n\nThis time I was able to park close. I was very happy about my experience there, as I have always been. I proceeded to the counter area where there is open seating. I don't like waiting for a waiter and having the host or hostess point me to an area.\n\nI was acknowledged right away and proceeded to order. As usual, I had the Bear's Choice Breakfast for $9.99 (served all day). It used to be like $6.99 or $7.99 a few years ago, but prices have gone up. The breakfast includes two eggs of your choice; your choice of two bacon strips, two sausage links, or ham steak; and your choice of two slices of French toast, two pancakes, a waffle, or biscuits and gravy (either four or six biscuits I think). There is also an orange slice garnish.\n\nThe biscuits for my meal were big (unlike at Denny's, for example), and there was a ton (and I mean a ton) of sausage gravy. I almost had to bring it home it was so large. The eggs, which I ordered over-hard, were perfect, and not greasy. The ham steak was cooked well and had no or little fat on it. And, the orange slice garnish this time, which I always eat, was thickly cut at this particular location (like getting two for one)! I added orange and strawberry jelly to my biscuits to sweeten them up.\n\nWhen I was done, the waitress brought my check really quickly,which is good, as I hate waiting like I do at places like Denny's, IHOP, Carrow's, or Coco's.\n\nI have no complaints. This was a quick, good-sized, easy meal for a fair price, and I was very satisfied at the end.\n\nAnd as always, this Black Bear Diner features a mini store inside. Some are small, some are bigger. This store was walk-in and was large. They sell items like keychains, back scratchers, onesies, t-shirts, towels, mugs, their hot sauces, and teddy bears.\n\nThey all feature a juke box as well, and plenty of bear-themed decor, including hand-carved life-sized bears on the outside and inside, with some stores having hand-painted murals.\n\nThis place is really popular on weekends and Friday nights. On Friday afternoon and evenings is when they have prime rib and all-you-can-eat fish frys.\n\nBe sure to join there passport program, modeled after the National Parks Service program. You get a stamp for each of their locations you go to (only one per restaurant), and they have over 100 now in 14 western states. At so many stamps, they send you a $5 gift certificate (called Bear Bucks) and a prizes like a backpack, blanket, license plate holder, nice jacket, mini gym bag, keychain, and tumbler. I also got a bonus gift last Christmas, a very nice and expensive insulated tumbler. You get a window sticker just for joining. There are different levels you can achieve.","date":1558835704000}

Once I walked in, there's no one to greet you.  One guy standing at the counter in the back.  Behind him is a hand writing menu on a poster.  $8 for pork, $9 for beef, etc.   No credit card accepted if your bill less than $25.  Once you gave your order and paid.  You get to find yourself a table.  Wow.  So is this self service?  Does it mean I don't have give tips?   Wrong!  I asked the guy where's my water?  He said no free water.  Either you buy bottle water or soda from us.  Wow!\nDoes he know it's the law to give free water?  Anyway... The lady from the kitchen bought out our dumplings.  Opened the bamboo cover and found six tiny pieces of dumplings.  $8 for six tiny pieces?  Talk about inflation!  There's a mandatory size for dumplings even supermarkets has bigger pieces in the frozen department.\nUncomfortable seat, no music, you can hear everyone's conversations.  One entrance door.  If a new customer comes in, the wind draft will blow everything off your table.  Zero service.  I just left a few bucks on the table and call it a day.\nSo stop the bitching and tell us how's the dumplings?  My honest answer to you is that you can find this in any dim sum place, and cheaper with service and free water.","date":1509130020000}

I had a glass of Cabernet and ordered the dry rubbed & grilled Geisert farm pork chop with fresh baby spinach, mashed sweet potatoes and drizzled with some balsamic reduction. I wanted to try an appetizer but I wasn't too hungry so perhaps next time. The pork chop was cooked perfectly, I wanted it more done than how they normally would cook it but it didn't turn out tough or anything.

One word: Heaven! I wish I had taken a picture of such delicate perfection but I was too excited and I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into some drizzled dark chocolate deliciously sinful goodness (it was that good that I don't even care if my description goes well together).

We didn't get the mussels, but I saw it come out of the kitchen and it looked and smelled amazing.\n\nI can understand some of the complaints about service and atmosphere, but really what else can you expect from small little gems like this.  The waitstaff was 2 people with only 1 or 2 people in the kitchen.  It can be crowded and somewhat loud if the dining area is full.  I think if you go here know that, there's really not much to complain about as the food is pretty great.  The prices are very reasonable (nearly all entrees under $20) given the high quality of the food.\n\nThis place would definitely be in my list of Top 10 Places to eat in New Orleans.\n\nOne thing I haven't seen mentioned in other reviews is that they are \"CASH ONLY\"","date":1320951402000}

I always get a smile, everyone seems happy for my business, and only once has anything taken a very long time - and it came with a sincere apology. The \"burger brigade\" kitchen has already been mentioned, but I'll mention it too - it's neat having your order announced, then called back from the kitchen.\n\nThe food is good. It's almost-but-not-quite fast food, in the vein of a classic burger bar. They believe a good burger takes a little extra time, and they aren't wrong. Oh, and they DO make a damn good hamburger. You can order a basic burger and garnish it to your heart's content, or get one of their specialty burgers - it doesn't matter, really, because I've been working my way through their menu and it's all pretty great. Can't say I've had a burger yet I haven't really enjoyed.\n\nThe fries are a slightly different matter. The fries are good, make no mistake - but the specialty fries are all a little disappointing to me. The nacho fries and chili fries are a neat idea - but just don't quite taste as good as I had hoped. The gravy is pretty good, though - and the poutine is okay.\n\nThe milkshakes? Order them. All of them. Always. Don't bother with fountain pop - just get a damned milkshake.

Definitely my favorite steak house in Tucson! I come here solely for the prime rib. It is amazing! I have tried prime rib at other restaurants but they don't even come close to Silver Saddles. The service is always great. Employees always greet you with smile and try to get you seated as soon as possible. Its usually pretty busy, thats expected because it is so good! They have a salad bar that you go get yourself. It is always stocked and fresh.

Now I'm not a big eater of Mexican Food, as a matter of fact I never go. My wife enjoys it when she goes out with the sons or her friends. So this was a pleasant surprise to her when we pulled in.\n\nThe place looks like a dive on the outside, like they just moved it in on flatbed from Tijuana. Once inside, it was rather dark, but once your eyes got adjusted it was fine. The inside was spacious.\n\nI ordered the Burrito Fajita - Steak  and my wife ordered the Flautas Mexicanas - Chicken  with a side of rice. \n\nTons of chips and a neat like sauce in a small carafe is served. The bowl is to pour the sauce into for the chips (I think). \n\nThe Burrito was a decent size, about 12 inches, and was rather delicious. I'm not a big fan of sour cream on anything but I ate it on the accompanying lettuce. The pico de gallo was fine and since I never ate guacamole, I had it and found it to be rather tasteless. I just wished the lettuce, the pico de gallo, guac and sour cream were wrapped up in it and served like a Stromboli and not alongside it. It was supposed to topped on it. If it was me, I'd put it in. \n\nMy wife said her meal was very tasty and her guacamole was spicy hot. \n\n Afterwards she ordered fried ice cream. It was massive and had two cherries on top. It came with two spoons. \n\nShe removed the one spoon, popped down the two cherries and before you could say boo, ate the whole thing herself.\n\nPGA Champ Gary Woodland and his wife came in as we were leaving.

It wasn't too busy, but all of the staff were very attentive and friendly. \n\nWe had a hard time deciding how to order since we were hungry (two smalls or one large), but we decided to split a large which definitely was the right call. \n\nOur server recommended we get a salad due to the cook times of the pan pizza (20-25 min), so we ordered a caprese salad.\n\nCaprese salad: probably the best I've had. The balsamic was not overbearing, and the mozzerella actually had a flavor. The tomatoes were heirlooms and packed a lot of flavor themselves. A great salad to split with a friend while waiting on the pie.\n\nThe pizza (the Kingpin-meatball, garlic and onions) came out in a pan and we were served our first slice by our server. DELICIOUS. This place has quality ingredients, but the pizza itself is not super exotic or fru-fru. The crust is pillowy soft with a great flavor, I mostly ate it with a fork. \n\nDespite our appetites, we could only finish half of the pizza and took the rest home. \n\nThe price was reasonable for what we got. Our check was about $33 for two soft drinks, a featured pizza and the caprese salad. A whole pizza at other comparable places will run $18-22, so I found the price more than fair, but it's not dirt cheap. \n\nWe didn't get drinks, but the bar area looked relaxed and comfortable with two big screen tvs and a decent beer selection on tap. The decor and ambience of the place was very clean with a coordinated feel, without being pretentious at all--very comfortable. \n\nWhat I really want to try is their all-you-can-eat pizza buffet for 8.95. It is advertised as seven days a week during lunch hours and includes a caesar salad. They are basically giving away some of the best pizza in the city for free! \n\nNOTE: A word on 'Chicago style' pizza. Midway pizza is pan pizza. I might call it deep-dish as well. The outside of the crust is slightly crispy from the butter\/oil used to coat the pan, while the rest is soft and doughy. \n\nChicago style pizza, as I have had (but am no expert on) is in a much deeper dish that takes 45 minutes to cook. Cheese is baked directly on top of the crust, and sauce baked on top of the cheese. The crust is similar to Midway's, but it really is a different beast.","date":1317134964000}

On our way in to Reno I searched for some Mexican food and this place came up, which is actually more popular for its El Salvadoran cuisine. I saw they had pupusas, which I'd never even heard of so I was excited to try them. It's a small, casual place tucked into a little plaza. It actually looks kind of \njanky inside, like some of my favorite local Chinese places in Ohio. It was empty when we got there and all of this was perfectly fine with me!\n\nThe menu had a lot of stuff on it, and plenty of options for the tacos and pupusas. The staff was really friendly and our water was a young guy who spent a ton of time talking to my dad about hunting, which I appreciated. (My dad has a tendency to over-talk his welcome). We're from Ohio so it was interesting to hear about the differences and the fact that he was a young guy at the end of his shift and didn't rush us was pretty cool. \n\nI asked what he recommended for the pupusas and he said that a traditional one had pork, beans and cheese so I got one of those and one with veggies. There are a TON of options. I also got a taco, pork carne asada. My dad got a lunch plate with a taco, pupusa, rice and beans for around $7.50. You also have the option of homemade tortillas for your tacos, which my dad got. I had regular. Both were delicious.\n\nI have been to other restaurants since and I can say that these tacos and pupusas are definitely larger than others. I can hold my own when it comes to eating but I finished my pupusa and taco and wasn't miserable but I did take my veggie pups home. The pupusas come with a thin red sauce (not spicy) and curtido (an El Salvadoran cabbage slaw which is lightly fermented and crunchy) which is delicious. It actually reminded me of an asian slaw as far as the flavor, but it's delicious with the pupusas and my dad and I fought over the last of it.\n\nI plan to go back here and try some other stuff but honestly the pupusas were so good that I find myself craving them every time I'm wondering where to eat. \n\nTruly this place is awesome, and you should try it.","date":1497246317000}

After I had been hiking around all day, first in the desert, then in the mountains, then in the dark downtown, their server was so sweet and helped me pick the most perfect, comforting dish of Gnocchi. I chose it half-and-haf with a hearty authentic meat sauce on half and the most delicious most mouthwatering gorgonzola sauce on the other. Even their bread was good, served with a yummy herb butter. The restaurant was not very busy and I didn't even go inside, since it was perfect weather to eat on the patio. So I have no comments on the decor or atmosphere.

Ordered the Piggy Back Shrimp which we enjoyed, very crisp bacon which was perfect. However, portion size is like fine dining, 4 to an order and $12 is a little steep.  We both decided to Build Our Own Burger option. I order the Akaushi-Kobe (medium rare) on Brioche Bun (loved the bun) with Aged Goat Cheese, Lettuce, Caramelized Onions which was delicious!!! My friend also ordered the Akaushi-Kobe (well done) with Cheddar Cheese, Caramelized Onions, which was also delicious. We also ordered one order of fries to split which are served in basket and enough to share. They are hand cut, fried and have sprinkle kosher salt on them. Yum!! I would definitely say I would rate the burger as one of top burgers I've have had in New Orleans. I will go back to try more. I would say though, if your in a rush or only have an hour lunch, you may want to order a head of time and pick up. We waited at least 45 mins between appetizer and getting our burgers. Also my burger temp came out medium well and not medium rare which wasn't a major deal but a little disappointed.","date":1377847372000}

I love the harissa aioli.  As for the burgers, they are huge and darn delicious, though I can rarely finish one if I order fries. I usually get the smashed onion burger, with the aioli, bacon, and horseradish cheddar, no lettuce and tomato.  I've ordered with lettuce and tomato before and I feel like it makes the already huge and kinda messy burger a little too messy and hard to eat.  I also ordered without bacon once and I found the burger to be a little meh, but it may have just been an off night or something.  Or maybe bacon really does make everything better, I'm not going to test that theory by ordering without bacon again.  The only real problem I've had with the place has been getting a burger cooked how I like it.  I like my burgers medium rare.  They seem to have a hard time achieving that.  Most times I've gotten a burger that has been quite rare, a little too rare.  I've attempted ordering medium, thinking maybe that would do the trick, but then it's been too cooked.  The burgers are still tasty either way, but I'd love to order and get a true medium rare burger.  In addition to the burger and fries, I've also ordered the mac and cheese on several occasions and the Dr. Pepper pulled pork sandwich once.  The mac and cheese is peppery, I happen to like black pepper on everything, so this works for me; cheesy, peppery, and yummy.  I like it best when it's cooled a little and the cheese sauce has more of a creamy texture.  The Dr. Pepper pulled pork was good as well, but maybe a little too sweet for me.  I'm really not a sweet person though, so I think that's just me.  I think it would have been awesome with some type of slaw on it.  The pork was great, even if I did find the sauce too sweet for me, the buns they use are awesome, the option of some slaw might make the sandwich for me.  Sadly, I have yet to try one of their shakes, but I plan to fix that soon!","date":1300315511000}

My side was the potato salad, the flavor was good but the potatoes were hard, some were not even cooked, yes, raw crunchy potato. The waitress kindly told me they had already had complaints and she tried them and agreed they should not have served them. She brings me the chicken dumpling soup as a replacement for the potato salad since I just tried my wife's soup and loved it. The soup she brought me was so salty, I couldn't even eat it.

This is a favorite weekly haunt for a friend, so 10 of us made reservations for dinner on his birthday.  \nIt was a very weird experience.\nWe were all seated at 6:30, which was when our reservation was for.  Chips and salsa took nearly half an hour to arrive, which was unfortunately quicker than our initial drink order, which took well more than half an hour.\nThis process kept repeating itself, right down to the very slow arrival of our entrees - some two hours after we were seated.  They must have been ready some time earlier, however, because they didn't just arrive late - they also arrived cold.  I think that my octopus special might have been really delicious when it came off the stove, but it certainly didn't cool well.\nThe restaurant is reasonably pleasant, if a bit loud, on the interior.  The outdoor seating is lovely.\nFor a restaurant that charges the price that Santa Fe does (figure 10-15% premium on comparable places such as Superior Grill), and carries the reputation that it does, the service absolutely has to be better. \n\nA final note - parking is tough to find in this neighborhood at dinner time.\n\nI'm sure we'll be back eventually to give it another chance, but this was a major disappointment.  For perspective, I think this may be my first two-star review - I'm usually a fairly easy grader.","date":1525150616000}

My friend had the Cubanito - that was probably the best out of all 3.

I also indulged in one of their tiny adorable Martinelli's apple juice...my new favorite!

For a \"newer\" Dunkin', this location lacks many basic principles of quality and customer service. I've given them multiple tries, for the sake of that it is right in my daily driving area to work. They have let me down each and every one of them. Shame on me for expecting different. Lines are long, drive thru and inside the place. Associates more concerned with their cell phones and convos between each other. When you do get some \"help\" they give you shortness and attitude. This morning was actually the reason I decided to review this place. I drove up at about 530 am, and mind you, the hours are posted for opening at 5 A.M. when I got there,  there was 2 cars in front of me. They took a while to order and I just chalked it up to the usual Dunkin' biz. When I got to the drive thru speaker, I waited three minutes and said \"hello?\" No response. I drove up to the pickup windo and there is a woman, giving me a Michael Myers mean mug stare down and wouldn't open to talk to me or even apologize for the lack of service. This Dunkin' needs a serious overhaul. I won't be back until I hear or read differently about it.

I waited an additional half an our. I was irritated but did semi-expect it due to the fact that it was a fight night and we expected them to be busy. I got all the way home only to realize that the order was wrong! I was LIVID. I called and they told me that they could bring out new wings (which would take an hour and a half) or they could credit free wings to my account. I took the credit.

The first time I came here, it was for my husbands birthday. Lets start off with the fact that I love a restaurant where you can either wear jeans and a shirt or dress up for special occasions, and you still get a fabulous meal. The restaurant has a very casual  decor, with cartoon drawings of famous people. But the service and attention to detail is not casual. We ordered shrimp cocktail, a 5 lb Lobster butterflied and filled with crabmeat, a Porterhouse steak, side dish of broccoli and a bottle of Dom P. Everything was perfect!! We didn't feel rushed, even though we placed our order for the full meal. Between every course the waiter came over and brushed the crumbs and cleared the table.\nThe food was perfectly cooked... the lobster was the best I ever had! There's just nothing better! Our bill came to $500.00 and $600.00 with tip. But this was a special occasion, this is not our normal dinner.\nIf you join their membership club, you get \"credits\" built up from your dining visits and is good towards their cookbook or future dining. You also get great email offers for specials.\nAnother time we went for dinner, they had a special for a \"Lobster for 2\" meal where you got a 4 lb lobster and a side dish\/appetizer and dessert for like $75.00. If you wanted to, you could pay the additional fee for larger lobster. We would go and get this deal, plus add a steak for my husband. The check would come to about $150.00-200.00. This deal is usually around August.\nAnother deal they had was a 3 course meal for $49.00pp, that was a recent special.\nThey also have a great happy hour at two different times daily, at 5pm and I think again at 9pm, which is a great deal!! Delicious food for like $5-10 and great drinks, you can't beat it.\nMy point is that, whether you spend $50.00 or $500.00 you will get a meal that is worth your money.

Our group of 6 arrived at 7pm so we could get a table, and grabbed beers while we waited. There was a private event happening upstairs until 8pm, so we had to stay downstairs until it was over. A big crowd of people were gathering at the bottom of the stairs, and right at 8pm they started letting people up. People were pouring in from outside and it was a mad race for tables. By the time we got upstairs through the crowds, there were no tables left. After waiting one hour for quizzo, we had to leave and go somewhere else. They need a better system for this, or not have events that end at 8pm when their quizzo starts at 8.","date":1566951818000}

They just upped their prices a little while ago so it might seem a bit pricy. But they keep their menus for a really long time, so keep checking back and the value continues to go up. My favourite is jap chai which is soft glass mungbean noodles with veggies- 17 dollars. My friend loves the mountain veggie hot pot. Also 17 dollars-- if the decor were a bit less old and musty, we wouldn't flinch at these prices- Biera is a case in point. But the inside of this restaurant hasn't been redone since the 70's (just guessing)- I'll post some pics next time I'm there. Plenty of gluten free choices, although they don't market them as that.

Another must try is one of their salad with in house made dressing. They make a lemon pepper dressing that goes very well on the chicken tender salad or just a side salad before dinner as well as a ranch. Their ranch is great on literally everything.

Reviews on Yelp were positive so last night we placed a take out order to give it a try. \n\nThe menu is impressive : Chinese, Thai, Sushi and Vietnamese food - all available.  \n\nThe first thing that stood out was the wait time on the order - 20-25 minutes. I can not remember EVER ordering Chinese food that wasn't ready in 15 minutes. I thought this must either be the busiest local restaurant of its kind or they spend extra time getting everything ready. \n\nSure enough, there were take out bags everywhere when I arrived. The restaurant is clean and much larger than it appears from the outside. A sushi counter is located in the front. \n\nI recognized the owner who appears on a video on their website home page holding down the front of the house. I love seeing an owner who is there making it happen in prime time. \n\nThe won ton soup was tasty - nice broth with delicate noodles that fell apart when eating as opposed to those other versions that use noodles that are hard and industrial strength. \n\nThe egg rolls were so-so. House made hot mustard was excellent. \n\nPork fried rice was decent.\n\nMy lady's Kung Pao chicken was good with cashews instead of peanuts. \n\nEasily the highlight was the all white meat with no upcharge General Tsos chicken.

From what I understand, it was a smart move to visit on a weekday. It was quiet when I arrived at around 8 AM, but the place had filled up even closer to 9. Glad I didn't have to wait in line to grab a seat!\n\nThe menus are kind of cool. I do love photos of the food in menus, although a photo of every item was overkill. I think the menu is actually really, really small - the photos just stretch it out to 4 pages when really it could all fit on one. The paper placemats on the table were tacky.\n\nIn an effort to be healthy, I picked a fruit place with yogurt. I noticed kiwi in the picture, when I'm mega-allergic to. I told our waitress, who wrote it down and noted it's a common allergy, but when my food arrived, the fruit tower was adorned with kiwi fruit, plus kiwi crushed up into the yogurt.\n\nI had to wait a couple of minutes for her to come back and requested a new plate. She apologized and brought me back the only edible part of my order, the bagel and cream cheese. About ten minutes later, the rest of my order arrived, sans kiwi.\n\nThe food was very average. I know a fruit plate doesn't sound very exciting to begin with, and the presentation was excellent, but that was about it. The apple slices were cool (but they still had seeds in them, so I had to re-slice them myself anyway) and the fruit fan was pretty, but the fruit really average, and the bagel was subpar. And honestly, $11 for decorative fruit is way too expensive, especially when my fiancee had a full plate of eggs and meat for the same price.\n\nWhen we finished up but still had full cups of coffee, the waitress dropped the bill on the table and simply said, \"You can pay up front.\" It was really awkward because we clearly weren't ready to leave, but we sort of felt pressured to go. She never came back to refill our coffee.\n\nIf a friend invites me here, I'll follow, but I won't suggest this place to anyone else for a breakfast date. I'll stick to quirky Barb and Ernies or follow Jessica D's recommendation to Hap's Hungry House from now on.","date":1302123656000}

I should first speak very favourably of the staff - the hostess and waiters were all friendly and efficient. Per Steven's comment below I'll note that we found Chuck to be extremely friendly and helpful, I guess anyone can have a bad day. Our appetizer soups were solid and tasty, and the wine selection is just about awe-inspiring. Sadly, the beer selection does not match up here and could definitely use some care and attention. Our mains - we both ordered the pork chop - was unfortunately seared and then cooked entirely in the microwave. We know this because we sat across from the open kitchen and watched them do it. What we received was an unseasoned, scalding and dried out piece of meat that, to be honest, was a big disappointment.\n\nBased on the recos of others we can only assume we hit it on an off-night as the preparation and quality of the food didn't match what was expected. I'm issuing a reasonable rating anyways but hope someone from Bobby's is paying attention and ensuring top quality food is consistently being served.","date":1263921627000}

If I had been bitching, the pint wouldn't have meant as much, but doing it on his own meant a lot.  That's taking care of the customer, IMO.  Wells St. FatBurger was amazing as were the fries (which are all shapes and sizes, showing they actually cut up potatoes to make them).\n\nSecond time in, I had the opposite.  Great service, food left much to be desired.  Wells St. was ordered medium and came out something between cold and rare.  Couldn't even finish it.  Had a couple bites of my friend's brisket, which was OK.  Definitely tender and showed they'd taken their time with it, but lacked any real smoke flavor or seasoning.  Some might chalk this up to regional preferences (lived in TX for a while) but to me it tasted more like a really good pot roast than brisket.\n\nThird time was the best of both worlds.  The Wife and I both ordered a simple hot dog with a basket of tots.  I was worried I'd still be hungry, but this isn't a cheap hot dog from \"dime a dog\" night.  Vienna beef frank really hit the spot and we both left satisfied (insert joke here). In addition to the food, they have Old Style for those who miss the Wrigley outfield bleachers, along with several rotating guest taps.\n\nLike I said, three visits, three different experiences. While Fat Dan's probably won't turn into my favorite place in town, they've kept me coming back, which is what any restaurants should aim to do.","date":1366744866000}

Tonight's meal was literally tasteless. Folks, if you're paying $90 for a family of 2 to have a meal and it must be thrown away for several reasons from the meal having no seasoning to not being cooked properly to all food being presented cold to the entire meal being questionably fresh--and smelly (eww!)\nYou deserve more, or at least your money's worth for such a pricy meal.\n\nAs far as customer service, I was told it was  bad because they hired a new girl. Trained improperly, the 'new girl' was flippant with me when I asked her to take my card. This Bonefish Grill can never keep anyone employed in this position. How management treats their employees should be addressed in this case..BUT!!\n\nManagement changes as often as I change my socks, and that is a bad thing. Consistency is sorely lacking lately. \n\nOh, and don't EVER ORDER the TRUFFLE MAC & CHEESE as one of your two SIDES!!! It is so gross and too heavy on the Truffle oil! Blech!!\n\nI feel I must lower my rating for this failing chain to an average 3*. \n\nThey don't even have Oysters Rockefeller anymore, but it still says so on their Yelp!!! IT tech needs to fix this!!\n\nThey claim they no longer make Oysters Rockefeller because they prefer to have fresh seafood, and that item doesn't move fast enough to stay fresh. Really? Lame!\n\n\n8\/100\n\n&&&&&&&&&&&&\n\nYou want Fresh, High-quality Fish and Shellfish? As well as Prime steaks, too? You can get that here, along with a super-comfy, darkly-lit atmosphere, composed of dim ambient lighting placed strategically throughout the restaurant's walls, amidst small and large tables draped in linen tablecloths. I like how dark it is inside, and the ambient lighting is nice.\n\nThis is an interesting restaurant chain, one that has kept it the same over the years with really good quality food. Fresh and high quality fish and shellfish is definitely Bonefish Grill's forte'.  The vibe here is quiet and understated, relaxed and cool, a place you should indeed linger. \n\nCustomer service is top notch of course. The restaurant chain also operates Carraba's Italian, Flemings Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar, Outback Steakhouse, and Roy's. \n\nFrom Bone Fish Grill's wood-Fired grill in the kitchen, came delicious mussels, and though they are  some of the best, they were missing that delicious crostini, with garlic olive oil, and Parmesan cheese melted on a pillowy but crisp bread to sop up that delectable broth. It's some of the best I've had. But there was no bread and I really love mussels. Yummy!\n\nTheir Tilapia is also delicious. I had it blackened, which was nicely done with just the right char, tender and juicy. Delicious. I squeezed a little lemon on it and it had just that tad better nuance. They have a wide selection but I've only been here a few times. And would definitely come back.\n\nWe had no problems with ordering, picking up, and eating delicious food that's worth the money. Both times dinner for two here was around $50.00 with wine. \n\nWill for sure be back again and again.","date":1485565747000}

I wanted to give myself several visits before my review and it's a good thing that I did. The few small kinks that I had early complaints about have disappeared over the past couple months, as expected.  I can now, confidently, say that this location is on par with every other Portillo's I've been to over the years in the Chicagoland\/NWI Indiana area.\n\nNow I'm not an Italian Beef fan, so if you also fall under that umbrella do not let it stop you from paying this place a visit. Chicago style hotdogs, burgers, chicken sandwiches, fries, ribs, salads, shakes, and beer!! I have honestly never ordered something that I did not enjoy. My go to is the bacon cheeseburger but I typically switch between that and a hotdog depending on the day.\n\nAnd last but not least, the cake! Their chocolate shake is delightful!! So much so that they offer small pieces of it in their chocolate cake shake.\n\nThe only thing I hope is that they open one on the west side soon.","date":1542830110000}

There were definitely still a lot of people but no lines for us! \nIf you can only have 1 meal here, I'd recommend the ribs with the baked beans and potato salad. DELISH!!  My parents also really enjoyed the fire & ice pickles but I'm not much of a pickle fan. Also, I really wanted to try the burnt ends but they were already sold out by then so I went with the brisket. It was good but those ribs are where it's at! Parking was scarce because of the Mardi Gras celebration but we were still able to find a spot by the farmers market across the street. Go to Bogart's!

I opted for the Chia Banana Boost and customized it such that it also had the Splenda substitute, added strawberries, and removed dates.  The smoothie itself comes with roasted banana, chia seeds, almonds, whole-grain oats, cinnamon, and coconut (& dates too but I removed them).  On top of that you get a choice of strawberries or peanut butter - of which I chose the strawberries.  I was absolutely blown away at how AMAZING this smoothie tasted.  This was by far the BEST smoothie I have ever had.  My only issue with it is that it was so good that I drank it too fast and got brain freeze!  This is my new GO TO smoothie from now on.  I really don't think I would change a thing.\n\nIn addition to the smoothie, I also ordered the All American Wrap - a breakfast wrap with ham, eggs, bacon, mozzarella & cheddar.  This breakfast sandwich was really good.  I especially like the press that was done to it which allowed for some of the wrap to have a nice crisp to it.  Excellent breakfast wrap!\n\nThe food delivery app that I used will come in very handy for me since it allows me to just re-order the same thing with the single press of a button.

I've only been to one other stop that's been on Triple D (in MN) so I wanted to check another one off of my list. TBBC is in the Ybor City district of Tampa. It's a really cool old town type of area. My only complaint is that parking is a mess. You either got to hit the lottery and find something on the street or find a garage. Unfortunately for me I parked somewhere where I thought I was OK but I ended up with a $30 ticket.\n\nThe inside of TBBC is pretty typical of most your brewpubs these days. Lots of seating, a big bar with TVs, the works. I think it would be a great place to belly up and watch the game at or just to stop by and grab a few beers.\n\nI was really excited about the food. One of the things that caught my eye when Guy was here was the Cider Wings. There was just something appealing about the idea of apple cider and hot sauce combined. So we started out with an order of those. We got eight fairly decent sized wings and they were pretty good. I liked the tang of the cider and my wife liked that even though there was a little bite from the hot sauce it wasn't overpowering. These were really good wings.\n\nI ordered the Bomb, which is a burger wrapped in pizza dough with onion strings and cheese, then baked and served with horseradish sauce. Again, it was really good. The pizza dough almost made it too filling but I guess I would rather have too much than too little. My wife stuck with their standard cheese burger. She said it had a lot of flavor and was cooked to her liking.\n\nI was able to try a couple of pints of beer. Both were pretty decent. I had already been at Cigar City earlier in the day so I strayed away from some of the higher proof beers. I had a red and and another I can't remember off of the top of my head. Like I said, decent, especially for daily drinker type beer.\n\nThis is another spot where I will make sure I come back to the next time I make it to Florida. Next time though I will be certain to find a parking space that doesn't cost me $30.","date":1432328115000}

But, for the right reasons. I haven't come in here in many years because I never feel welcome here, and its all because of Tim. Tim is the older, depressed guy (looks like Trey Anastasio) who tends bar and always gives back rude service. I've been nothing but respectful to him but in return I get crapped on. I didn't tip him because of this. After the third time, he called me out on it and I straight up ignored him and told my old h.s. friends (who worship Stagger of all the bars in Edwardsville) that I'm choosing somewhere else. Hey, if you're rude and disrespectful to your client\/customer\/guest\/whatever, do you really expect something back in return? Ask yourself that once in a while. If people want to consider 'being rude' as service, please count me out. I've heard it said that he's that way with just about everyone, but not hot, young women. Many people tell me never to take Tim seriously, but he's also rude when he's NOT working. One time he was off the clock and sitting by the door and he yelled at me because I accidentally left the secondary small doors open. I really don't understand why people love this place; I mean, I really do want to like it. Because Tim still works there I refuse to set foot in good ol' Stagger. It wouldn't do me any good to complain to the owner(s) because they know that somehow their boy brings in all the drunk college kids\/kool-aid drinkers.

Suffice to say it was excellent.  I also enjoyed the soup of the day which was a wonderful creole tomato bisque (I still heart creole tomatoes!!)  The bread pudding was good but average.  I was least impressed with their crab cake.  I suggest just skipping that one, (but not across the water like a stone, because it's way to soft for that.

This used to be a regular weekly stop when I worked near the joint a while back. I loved the way they saran-wrapped the lunch specials. I loved the older gentleman who would take my orders. I loved the younger girl who would welcome me back and scold me whenever I had skipped a weekly visit. \n\nI would like to point out that  whenever I ordered a non-lunch special, I was relatively disappointed. I spent more money for a less-enjoyed meal. In many instances, the dishes, even things I didn't think should be sweet, were overly sweet and soggy (think of a funnel cake that your friend accidentally spilt her water on, and you've nailed my experience).\n\nFurther, nothing on the menu was like \"oh my god, I have to have this every week\" the way I've felt about dishes at other places along that strip of Olive.\n\nOverall, Shu Feng lunch is the best deal for the price and has been the most satisfactory way that I have enjoyed this fine establishment.

I'm not a needy person, but it's so important to check back (and not wait until our plates are empty and we're asking for the check). Great grub, okay service.","date":1455669736000}

Pretty sure this is like a 95% profit margin. Well played Mafiaoza's & lesson learned. I even asked if that was how it was supposed to be - the manager informed me that yes it was correct.

This friend was female, so I think that kind of downgrades the service you receive because the women there are going to lay low on flirting with you. Not that it matters, anyway, because I'm not mesmerized by a pretty smile and a scantily clad woman.\n\nDecor is great and really gives a \"cabin\" feel to the establishment. The service is average at best, but I realize that this is largely dependent on your waitress. I ordered a \"Twin Cheeseburger\", which according to the menu should have had \"caramelized onions\" that were actually extremely thick slices of barely simmered onions. The burger also contained a very large portion of mustard to where the condiment actually dripped off the sides and overpowered the taste of the meat, which was more medium-rare than medium, which I had ordered. The patties were also paper thin. It was, in essence, a mustard-onion sandwich. Yeah, imagine that taste in your mouth.  My friend had \"Mom's Pot Roast\", and no, it wasn't anything like Mom's, if you get my drift. Overly smothered in gravy and the potatoes you get with it have the texture of partially dried concrete.\n\nThe beer...well, the beer is ice cold when you actually go get it from the bar yourself after waiting 10+ minutes for your waitress to figure out that you're a paying customer, too. I swear I ordered my beer and my waitress went right over to a table with some morbidly obese dude that she was trying to wring dry for tips and didn't leave until she saw me get up to actually go get my own beer. She tried to play it off by \"racing\" me to the bar, but, uh...no. There were crystals of ice at the top and no head on the beer, so it was like a beer snowball on the first sip.\n\nWe got up from the dining area and went to the bar after our \"meal\". The mixed drinks are good and strong. I had the \"Slow and Low, Old Fashioned\" and it was perfect. Perfect portion of rye whiskey with just the right amount of fruit. My friend ordered a Margarita which I tasted and that was pretty damn good, too. \n\nIn short, for food, you'd probably be better off going to Wendy's. Gordon Ramsay would have had a field day on my order. The food service was abysmal, the bar service was awesome, hence the initial average rating. This place does offer a great drinking atmosphere with good drinks and cold beer. \n\nIt's safe to say that I'll probably wind up here at the bar again in the future. But it's also safe to say that I'll never order another meal from here ever again. Ever.","date":1396253028000}

The wife and I had the meal for two that comes with a dessert and appetizer or salad AND included pastas to take home. The chocolate cake was a hit and plenty big for three people, honestly. The kids' meals were $6 and come with the drink and a dessert, so that's great too.\n\nFive of us (wife and kids 10, 4, 2) got out of there for $88, and that's including the 20% tip. That's not bad for appetizer and desserts. We've spent the same amount other places and left very disappointed.\n\nMy only gripes are minor. 4's flatbread pizza took a long time to get to the table because they apparently burnt the first one and had to redo it. The person who delivered our food told us that, and while I did appreciate the runner telling us what happened, and that they went ahead and redid it instead of serving him a burnt pizza, I think it's better service to have a manager come by at some point and simply apologize and explain the delay his or herself. That's my own opinion about how a successful restaurant operates though and, like I said, kudos to them for fixing the pizza without us ever having seen the original one.\n\nAlso, we were seated in a corner in the back of the restaurant (no problem here, I get it, we had two small boys with us) and it was near a kiosk where the servers entered orders for the kitchen and hung out when they had some free time. They were eating snacks and having four letter word laden conversations that were inappropriate for the setting. I'm not a prude by any stretch, but if we could hear it, then others could as well.\n\nStill, the food was good and our server was very good as well.

This time, My son and I went to Mesh to try their Devour Downtown menu.  We had reservations for 4:15 on Saturday, we made them early because he works on Mass Ave. and was to report to work at 6:00.  we arrived about 45 minutes early for our reservation but there was no difficulty getting seated early.  I suppose that should be expected and i'm sure they were happy to have our table free up a little early.  However, because we were so early, the Devour menu wasn't completely ready yet.  I certainly don't blame them for that.  Anyway.  we both started the meal with the Smoked chicken Chowder.  I really loved it.  the broth was creamy and rich with a little spicy kick and the chicken was smoky and nice.  The veggies were all cooked in the soup but not cooked into mush. the carrots and potatoes had texture and the corn had a surprising and welcome sweet snap when i bit into it.  I am a big fan of braised meats so i chose the Pork shank while my son chose the flat iron steak.  The shank was moist and delicious and was served with wheat berries and apples.  The wheat berries added a textural element while apples are a natural pairing with pork.  My only criticism was the whole dish was a little under seasoned.  A dash of salt improved it.  My sons Steak must have been good because It was gone before i could get a taste.  Unfortunately for him, there was a mushroom component to the dish and he didn't eat any of them because he doesn't like mushrooms.  Oh well, he knew the job was dangerous when he took it.  For desert we hand a well spiced bread pudding with ice cream and bourbon sauce.  It was a nice desert that wasn't too sweet.  I thought it good desert but I've had better bread puddings.  The service was outstanding with a server that had sampled the dishes ahead of time and was able to steer us to the best on the menu.  All in all It was a fun evening.","date":1391451193000}

A hostess recommended that I call an hour before we expected to be there. We arrived at 6, and our table was ready at 6.

Their menu is HUGE, and they have something for everyone...even in the way of (bottled) beer. The prices are a little high for the quality of the food. I chose the fish tacos...and...fries as a side?

So we ended up selecting the pork belly kabobs and vietnamese pork meatballs from the 5 dollar snack menu. Pros-good portion size to split between the 2 of us, and nice presentation\/plating. Cons- I wish the pork belly had some crispness\/crunch to it. It was served with a pickled green tomato so that cut the fattyness a bit. We ordered 2 sandwiches for dinner called the fried green tomato BLT and the Vietnamese pork meatball banh mi. Both came with yummy french fries. We liked the BLT. My banh mi, oh boy. I grew up eating these sandwiches as a kid. My sandwich was lettuce overload, it was dry (had to ask for some hoisin), and the bread was heavy, like it was meant for a cheese steak (it usually comes on a nice airy french baguette roll). I removed the lettuce, ate a few bites, then wrapped the rest (ate those fries though, hehe). For dessert, we had the only one they offered which was the cheesecake topped with blueberries and honey. Delicious, it made up for my banh mi. \nOverall, we enjoyed our experience at the Goat. We definitely will be back to try more cocktails and some of their Big plates\/specials.","date":1435385302000}

Our table was a two-top but quite spacious and we could talk easily despite the noisy restaurant. The atmosphere was delightful.\n\nOur waiter was absolutely wonderful. He was ready with suggestions for us and open to questions as well. We started with the frozen blood orange margaritas- to die for! It was decided that we will come back with friends to take advantage of the pitchers of margaritas, as well as to try some of the other selections (I had my eye on the Pink Cadillac, he on the traditional El Vez). \n\nThe food was out of this world. I am not the biggest fan of Mexican food but I can guarantee that I will be back. The original guacamole was well balanced and delicious. I chose the (surprisingly hearty) vegetable taco and my date the shrimp taco. Both were above our expectations. \n\nThe pricy selection prevented me from that 5th star, but for special occasions this is a home run.","date":1484224161000}

She ended up walking out, and when another customer joked that the cook had better pick up the pace, he just rolled his eyes, smiled, and said, \"You know, I've been here for 14 hours straight today, I don't care. And for every person that walks out, another five walk in.\" \n\nAnd even though they got every fussy detail of our order right, we ended up with a whole instead of half, which in homage to Parks and Recreation I call the \"child size\" steak, because it's about the size of a small child.

Spicy and flavorful served on a bed of the best pickled veggies which compliment each other perfectly.

I always love trying new places.\n\nI've been hearing a lot about this place, so I figured I would give it a shot since I was in the mall.\n\nThe sushi bar was not too clean when I sat down with my lady. The menu seems inexpensive, but the rolls are somewhat small. One of my rolls was not served as it was pictured on the menu either. They serve you in Togo containers even if you sit and eat there. They don't have Sriracha (odd for a sushi place). The bubble tea tastes like it came out of a packet. I didn't have an issue with the freshness of the fish which I have an instant palette alert for with sushi.

Perfect crunch and not overly seasoned or salty. The best part of the meal was the soup. My son got creamy potato with his steak and the other entree was beer cheese soup. Both were very good - above average for sure. Service was pretty good. Always had full drinks at the table and check came in a reasonable time. Bathroom was clean and in working order.

Also, a comfy spot to pick up morning coffee, hot tea or hot chocolate & freshly baked muffins and a morning paper (newspaper tote is also delivered to your room each day).\n\nBella Vista is the main dining room with patio seating that offers views of the Pacific Ocean.  I've eaten here a handful of times, brunch by far is my favorite meal here.  Brunch is popular and you don't have to be a guest of the hotel to dine here.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_user_photos\/MX2YGruhd0sMNHZGK7p5-Q\n\nHotel fever? Close by is downtown Santa Barbabra with plenty of eating establishments, bars and shopping.  At the end of State Street on the wharf are two places with good eats- Santa Barbara Shellfish Co. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/SZU9c8V2GuREDN5KgyHFJw?select=pnPENm__tHEgehi_8iIlTg#pnPENm__tHEgehi_8iIlTg and Brophy Bros.\n\nIts so hard to check out of here, Four Seasons Santa Barbara knows hospitality and the location and maintenance of the grounds speaks for itself.","date":1356897009000}

Green Eggs Cafe is VERY popular so the earlier you go, the better. The 20 minute wait was not bad at all and all the employees were very pleasant.

Well, around 9PM, one of the bouncer's got the idea that I was drunk, and I'll admit I was buzzed. He decided to kick me out.  I told him I would leave in peace just let me gather my things. No, apparently that was too much to ask.\nHe started dragging me from one end of the bar to the other. He wouldn't let me simply close my tab and grab my $189 dollar jacket. We get to the shady back door, where there is a stoop and six steps. I was literally thrown down the stairs. I landed on my hands and I was okay. So I started asking them to please just let me return inside to grab my jacket and my debit card because I had no money otherwise. No that was not possible. Okay so can you get it for me? \"NO, I'm not doing anything for you!\"  They kept saying \"do you want us to call the cops?\" I said \"go ahead!\"   I should have called them myself.\nFinally, after thirty minutes of this back and forth, being pushed around by these assholes and yelled at by them and by the manager, I gave up and ended up walking home over a mile because I couldn't get a cab with no credit card. And it was freezing out and I had no jacket. I returned there two or three times in the following days and never did get my jacket or my card back. Even met one of the owners one time and he didn't do anything for me.\nI'll never return to this place. The bouncers are total douche-bags, the manager is an asshole, and even the owners suck. It wasn't even that fun. I advise you to steer clear of this poop hole.","date":1374351690000}

The plate was dirty too. I was so worried that she cross contaminated the board and knife to my plate. I was about to ask my husband to leave but toughed it out. We ordered 2 rolls which should have tasted different from one another and they both tasted exactly the same. The fish was NOT fresh at all. The yellowtail I needed to touch to see if it was soft since it had a bad color. There was no flavor and hardly any fish inside the rolls. My husband had to get up and walk to the counter from the sushi bar to ask for water. The sushi lady (I will not call her a chef)never looked up or asked us anything until we received  the check. I'm am so happy it was only $26 which is cheap. Hopefully we won't be sick tonight since our stomachs are not feeling good after we ate there.

The roast beef was better than I expected, I must say, and they definitely had the variety.\n\nWas pleasantly surprised on the dessert bar, yes, there's a whole separate bar for that... to find two cobblers, banana pudding, a sugar free chocolate pudding, and the most fun of all... an ice cream freezer with all kinds of Purity treats... small little ice cream sandwiches, nutty buddies, ice cream cups (in case you want your cobbler a la mode, too).  I don't care who you are, or what the weather, that's just fun.\n\nIt's not fancy, and I dare say they have not renovated or redecorated since they moved into this location many years ago, but that's OK.

The interior needs updating so the only reason we've ever gone here is when we can sit outside.  \n\nThis time the service was excellent!  Although there were a lot of apologies from the servers to every table around us.  Plus ours. I felt bad for them.  I'll get into that later.  \n\nThe menu definitely changed.  Great selection.  Prices increased.  Maybe a little too expensive for the restaurant and quality.  I had the lamb chops.  They were very tender and cooked the way I asked.  My hubby had the seafood carnivale pasta dish which had a decent amount of shrimp, mussels, clams and calamari. \n\nWine selection was good. Everything came out pretty quickly but we didn't feel rushed.  \n\nWe ordered the burrata appetizer.  Then another server came over and told us the wrong menus were printed so that isn't an option.  No big deal.  We got the mozzarella sticks.  Seriously.....they were the same ones in my freezer that I buy in bulk.  I love frozen mozz sticks but they are a midnight snack to me.  At a restaurant with $40-60 entrees, they should be homemade and elevated a bit.  \n\nWe enjoyed our food, service and the atmosphere.  It just seemed like something was going on because we could hear apology after apology at all the tables around us.  The servers handled it well with pleasant attitudes.

The food has typically been decent over the years.  Never great, not usually horrible.  This has unfortunately changed over the past few years.  I have only rarely eaten inside this location.  The convenience of being able to order online, drive there, and have someone bring steaks to my car is just too great.  Or at least it would be if their cooks knew how to cook a steak to the temperature ordered.  I'd estimate that at least 75% of the time, my steak has been improperly cooked. I've lost count of how many times they've sent me away, only to get home and find that my \"medium\" steak is more often rare.  Every once in a while I'll get really lucky and end up with medium rare.  At least when it is under done, I can finish it myself.  Not that I want to, or I would have made my own dinner.  The last time, though, things were different.  My steak was beyond well done.  So dry as to be inedible.  The only thing that saved this restaurant from a one star review was the manager's response to my phone call.  She was very nice, and fully refunded my meal.  One of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to restaurants is when a steak place can't cook meat to the ordered temperature.  I mean, that's what they do all day, every day.  I haven't been back since my last experience, and doubt that I will.","date":1421303583000}

The restaurant is right across a hotel in a tunnel on 11th Street. I came after work, around 5pm, and was immediately seated; inside was a casual, clean area with cool oriental art. They accept credit cards, but with a $15 minimum (whereas Dim Sum Garden is cash only), so I decided to splurge for the day lol. I ordered the scallion pancake (~$3.50), pork soup dumplings (8 for $8.50), spring roll ($2.50), and two pork buns ($1.75 each), that just met that minimum. My favorites hands down were the scallion pancake and pork soup dumplings; the pancake was light and crispy, cooked just perfectly and the soup dumpling were larger than I imagined, and have such a satisfying taste to the last bite. The spring roll was ok, but I was mainly disappointed in the pork buns; it seemed like a meatball encased in the bun, which I guess I'm not used to having at my previous go-to place for dim sum. Service was excellent and very attentive. Will probably come back for my scallion pancake and soup dumpling fix.","date":1469190822000}

I completed the Yelp 100 Challenge! This is my 100th review in 2018! Overall 3.5 stars. Located in the US Bank CityPlace center (across the street from Range Rover) next to the New Balance store. Order at the counter & they bring your food to you. It's like a Chipotle for salads & pizzas.\n\nI'm in town and wanted to try to get something healthy, as well as try a place that I don't have back home in CA. I like the the name of this place. I dined in for lunch and ordered food to go for dinner.\n\nUpon entering, I was greeted by the worker and he kindly explained how it worked since I had never been there before. I had:\n\nThis Pear Is On Fire salad $8.89 while the salad itself was good, it's really overpriced for a small basic bowl of greens. The dressing is extremely spicy (and I like spicy), so I got a side of balsamic vinaigrette instead which was really good. 3.5 stars. \n\nCustom pizza $7.29 I requested extra sauce. Didn't get it. Barely any sauce. Pepper jack cheese with chicken (+$2) bell peppers, & mushrooms. I don't like how they are served on those thin trays where the bread hangs off the side and workers can touch your pizza and when they put it on the table it can also touch the table. Doesn't seem very sanitary. Having said that it was a fairly decent pizza. However, the crust was extremely bland and chewy. Blah. Put some garlic & olive oil on it! 3 stars. \n\nWild Spring Salmon small salad $9.39\nI got this to go with the dressing on the side and it held up really well. The salmon tasted farmed, but the description says it's wild. Between the two salads I liked this one better in terms of value because for less than $1 more, you get a generous portion of fish protein. 4 stars. \n\nHummus $6.99 while on the surface it looks pricey (and it is), at least this item was packed full of smoky flavor. It's a bit on the spicy side, but not to the point where it's inedible. Comes with bread and crackers & was quite delicious! 4.5 stars. \n\nSide of flat bread $1.79 Bland & chewy. It's the same as the pizza crust. Zero flavor. But great price for the size that you get. 2 stars.\n\nTheir bathrooms are clean. And while they have no paper towels or toilet seat covers (yuck!), at least they have a little napkin dispenser to open the door handles so I just used those napkins to dry my hands. Plus they have this little machine by the sink that beeps to tell you to wash your hands. It's meant for the employees but I think it's good for the public as well since a lot of people don't wash their hands. So I will say they are Jen G. Approved Bathrooms!\n\nFactoring in the nice and helpful workers & the more upscale atmosphere for being a fast casual restaurant, I will round up my 3.5 stars to 4 stars.\n\nOverall, while they could improve on some things, they're a little bit better than just A-OK.","date":1540082961000}

It's perfect for children's birthday parties & youth soccer team celebrations. There are different areas (room sections) in which to sit along w\/ an outside patio. There's also tables on the front grass alongside Gall Blvd. (See pics.)\n\nCounter service was fine. What wasn't impressive is the food. This is not Coney Island style! (Genuine Coney Island hotdogs are wrapped  in sheep intestines & Red Hots are also sold.) The dogs here are different only in there are \"short\" ones sold & \"long\" ones w\/ not much price difference. Obviously NOT all-beef dogs, these are NOT in their natural casings as many are up north. There are also no Reds sold here. Other than length, there's no choice w\/ regard to hotdogs. (You can; however, top them w\/ many different ingredients.) The dogs taste no differently than the SUB-PAR quality pork\/chicken\/beef dogs you find packaged in the deli section of ANY grocery store. Yup, no snap, no great flavor, no hearty dog-- just a wussy, quite flavorless thin hotdog swallowed up by a packaged, processed white roll. Again-- another everyday grocery store find. (The plastic-clad roll packs were left out on pallets in the dining room; they were marked \"Flowers Bakery\" & \"Country Hearth.\") The onion rings were uneventful-- uniformed, previously frozen, rather tasteless small rings; I had to top the few I ate w\/ lots of ketchup to add flavor. The unsweetened iced tea was poured (in plain view) from a grocery store gallon plastic jug on the counter; it wasn't even kept in the refrigerator as iced tea, especially in plastic, should be. The rootbeer float was good, but it's quite difficult to ruin store brand soda & store brand vanilla ice cream; the small-sized float was served in a small styrofoam coffee cup. \n\nWe won't return. The entire food experience was poor & VERY disappointing-- we could easily duplicate everything we ordered in our kitchen for much less money & probably make it taste better w\/ a little effort. However, the atmosphere\/decor was very nice-- kudos to the designer\/decorator and to the person responsible for the well-made wheelchair ramp w\/ full side rail was extremely generous considering the average age of Zephyrhills residents & snowbirds.  \n\nIf you have young kids or are a coach of a children's sports team, etc, this establishment may do; kids aren't generally particular about the food they eat while they're having fun together. If you don't fit into either category, I wouldn't spend the time or money on a visit. But that's just the opinion of two women who were originally thrilled to stop in for a northern dog, yet were served pretty crappy food.","date":1506134252000}

Unfortunately, the day we went, I was coming down with something that left me without an appetite.

So I had a few bites here and there, and was pleasantly surprised. They WERE amazing.\n\nAfter everyone finished their entrees, our server offered us a dessert menu, making sure to mention that strawberry shortcake is also available for the evening. I'm a sucker for a good strawberry shortcake and thought I could tolerate a few bites. However, when it showed up, I couldn't resist and uncomfortably pigged out. Oh, it was worth it. If you don't go for anything else go for the strawberry shortcake. Who knows how long it will be on the menu! Even though I guess it wasn't...\n\nHere's what it came down to: with one entree, a beer, and a dessert, the bill came to like $50 with tip. Most of the time, I get furious paying that much for food I know I can make myself at home. What I liked about Cochon is we walked out of there feeling like our money went somewhere good. I could NOT have made the stuff at home (except maybe the strawberry shortcake, but it was only like $7 anyway). It was not a waste of money. That means a lot these days.\n\nI plan to go again, and I plan to bring my appetite with me! If you have guests in town who want to experience some good local dishes, this is the place to go.

The food was good, all the seafood was cooked perfectly.\n\nEverything ran smoothly, service from Becky was perfect up until the end when we requested our bill.

I live right across the street and am kicking myself for not coming here sooner! The food was fresh and unique, colorful and flavorful. The atmosphere is cozy and relaxing with an gorgeous, lush outdoor patio that made us forget we were in Tampa! \nThe staff was extremely friendly and attentive, making sure everything was just how we wanted. This place was such a nice break from the usual fast-food and typical chain restaurants. Fresh, flavorful, colorful ingredients! A lot of organic stuff as well, including desserts!\nI had the Calabazo & Coconut Soup, with a slice of Limoncello cake for dessert. No regrets there! Such great flavor, and I didnt feel sick afterwards (which happens more often than Id like). My sister got a Garden Veggie Panini with a side salad and my mom got a Roast Turkey Salad. The food came out and it was almost too beautiful to eat! (see pictures)\nWe also got fresh-squeezed lemonade which was amazing, especially their flavor for that day: Apple-Pineapple Lemonade.\n\nAnother thing we loved was the Artisan bread that they serve you, today it was accompanied by Orange Honey Butter! \nWe sampled the real, homemade gelato and my sis decided on Dulche de Leche, my favorite was the Chocolate Biscotti! \n\nI dont know too many places around here that can compare to Seasons Fresh! Everything down to the details was absolutely perfect, I'm already excited to visit this place again!","date":1478291697000}

Both were extraordinarily stale -- it's not just that they were obviously not baked fresh that day, but that they seemed several days older than that! The croissant lacked any trace of a flaky texture, but tasted distinctly sour, like both the butter and flour had gone off.  \n\nFolks, if this is what you're planning on serving to paying customers, you may as well roll up the \"bakery\" sign and shut the doors for the day.

I decided to take the plunge, as it were.  The waiter assured me it was prepared from mean, Alligator Snapping turtles, with a penchant for biting; not the cute, little, red ears like the ones I had as a kid.  So, that was a comfort.

Definitely not your run- of- the- mill diner style dill pickle slices. I was already stuffed when my companions decided to order dessert.  \n\n Now, I'm not a big dessert person, I never have been.

I worked in this district Hyde Park for 12 1\/2 years circulated many fabulous restaurants in the village and very friendly people , made several friends over the years. Visited the area yesterday as I was in the area .  The service in this establishment was horrible . My husband and myself sat at the bar without being greeted or even approached we were stared at by the employees as we did not understand the concept of the restaurant or the menu. The only person that shared one bit of acknowledgment to us was an older gentleman that I do believe was kitchen help. When I showed that I was not very impressed with the lack of attention that we were given the manager or \"want to be manager \"female a little heavier set with long dark hair came over to approach me very rudely when I told her I didn't understand the menu and how the whole concept worked. She talk \ned to me like I was illiterate and I did not understand how to order from a sushi restaurant. Well I've never experienced a Mexican restaurant ordered like sushi. I don't make it a habit to not give an establishment a second chance but my exit out of this restaurant to be stared at, after the manager went across the bar to discuss her conversation with me and left 4 employees staring at me it was time for me to leave this establishment. Every customer is important and everyone should be acknowledged no matter whether they're a regular or not. I highly don't recommend this place. And as far as the Asian server with bleached hair on top , it wasn't necessary to glare at me for not ordering. This place needs some customer training.","date":1637183500000}

I love the food, the prices, and the sweet tea. Although all those wonderful experiences, my visit to this specific McAlister's was terrible. \n\nI ordered a Ceasar salad, cup of soup, and sweet tea. I got my sweet tea right away, grabbed a pickle and sat down with my friend. We waited about 30 minutes and our food still had not come out. I went up to the front desk and asked why, they responded that they were out of the soup we ordered so they had simply not brought our food. I still cannot understand why the didn't come ask us to pick a different soup, but they didn't. We ordered a different soup and sat down, another 10 minutes go by and no food. Finally I went to the kitchen and asked 3 different people to get the meals out. A 1 hour lunch break was quickly turning into potentially 2 hours. After standing there and watching them prepare our soup and salads they finally brought it to the table and apologized profusely. \n\nI appreciate that they tried to fix up everything for us and apologize, but that doesn't give me back the 40 minutes that they waited to finally prepare our food.

Here in the middle of \"nowhere\", i.e. Mullica Hill, you'll find a compact little market place that is a short drive from the outskirts of Philadelphia.\n\nWhat will you find here? The most obvious is a little restaurant that serves a hearty buffet. We were disappointed to learn upon arrival on a Saturday that on weekends, they only serve a breakfast brunch buffet. If you're good with a little bit of scrapple, ham, bacon, a variety of breakfast egg casseroles, fresh fruit, etc., then fill up. I was a little sad because I so enjoyed the Dienner's huge assortment at lunch in Lancaster with pot roast, roast chicken, chicken and dumplings.\n\nOtherwise, there were different vendors in the indoor market that sold everything from freshly made donuts, handpressed fresh orange juice, lots of different pies, breads, pastries, cheeses, cured and deli meats, etc. Of course, they offered their roasted chicken and meats, well worth paying a bit more for bringing straight home and eating right away. They also had vendors for fresh produce, different nuts and baking ingredients, and randomly, wine and flower arrangements.","date":1520268326000}

Today we decided to take visiting family out to our favorite pizza place...  We have been fans of FishHawk Pizza for years..... There have been many great visits and a few poor visits... Today's visit was the worse and raises questions in my mind... How can you get two different pizzas when you ordered them identical?   Currently, FHP is batting 4 out of five on getting the crust wrong... Numerous times of getting the cut incorrect..Today we had to ask 3 times for additional plates and tableware... What is now coming into question, is whether or not we are even getting a freshly made pizza; as opposed to one sitting on the shelf waiting for someone to order a slice (our odd pizza with all kinds of seasoning on it).. This is fully supported by the fact of the many times they failed to provide the correct crust or the correct cut.  One time we even received a triangle cut pizza that was then cut with an addition square cut! What a mess that was... Numerous times we have ordered extra cheese, only to be disappointed with the resulting pizza... Through all of this, we have taken the mis-steps in stride...however today was just too much... I could go on, but we decided to leave after realizing the many mistakes once again plaguing our pizzas...We finished our drinks and moved on..

Really good.  Maybe a touch heavy if you are used to a simply dressed Oyster Po Boy but it was unique and that was good.  \n\nNice service.  Reasonable prices.  MUCH better than standing in line for the Acme Oyster house which is around the corner.","date":1379773171000}

Dirty rice, seafood dressing, and cabbage.  I have yet to try them when getting home cause, the wife is still sleeping and I don't want to die. I did have a little bite of each side and they are I incredible! If the sides are this wonderful, you know the main is going to be fire!I did try one rib and that was so money! It was seasoned and fried perfectly. Some will say anything fried is good. No, no, no. Sometimes it can be over seasoned or over fried. This was perfection.

The wife and I just sat across from each other with smiles on our faces with google eyes from the food. Both of us sharing each plate and happy dancing in our chairs as we ate. We both are looking forward to many more incredible meals for them.\n\nUpdate 2: Desserts. The Banana Pudding is nice and creamy with plenty of banana and wafers. I'm particular about my pudding and this is one of the best I that have had. The Turtle Brownie is nice and light, not overly chocolatey or rich. I'm not a big chocolate person, however this I could eat a ton of. This young lady is creating some wonderful treats. What I'm excited for and it's pre-order only, is the Banana Pudding cake. Yes, you heard right a banana pudding cake!","date":1626201654000}

We went in and put our name in when we arrived. We asked for a first available table and they asked for my cell number and would text us when our table was ready. They said 15 minutes, but it was more like 5 minutes. We were seated outside and each table had a card on it. When someone left the card was flipped to red meaning the table needed to be cleaned. When the table was clean and disinfected they flipped the card to green. The tables were all about 6 feet apart and it was great. We were seated on the stage where normally they have live music, but I am sure they are going to just use this space now for diner and not live music. \n\nOur waiter came over very quick and took our drink orders. Our waiter was wearing a mask and had gloves on. We ordered our drinks and they were brought out and we ordered some appetizers. We got the Coconut Shrimp and the Bang Bang Shrimp. Both were supper yummy. I do wish the Bang Bang shrimp were tossed in the sauce. The sauce came out on the side. The appetizers came out very quick and were fresh and tasted great. \n\nFor our main entrees I got the Mahi Mahi Tacos, I ordered them blackened and they were delicious. You can choose either 2 or 3 tacos. I should have gone with 2. You get a really nice piece of fish in each taco and they are served with a cabbage slaw and fresh pico de gallo. You get 1 side with them, I went with french fries. My friend I was with got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken. It looks amazing and tasted great and he shared some with me. \n\nWe checked out using the little screen they had at the table and I did see them cleaning these in between people so that was very nice. I was really impressed by Bahama Breeze and how they created a safe and fun environment with great food! I will for sure be back and will for sure get the coconut shrimp again!","date":1589922603000}

The building is probably best know for a prior iteration as Tio Pepe, and the interior remains much the same, in a Spanish motif.  Plenty of separate rooms, lots of exposed stone and decorative railings.  Not exactly what you'd expect for a steak place.  But then, what WOULD you expect? \n\nThe menu is familiar, with all the steakhouse standards. Seltzers is known for their prime rib, and there are several choices available.  \n\nOur server, Naomi, did a great job.  She quickly took a drink order, offered help with the menu.  She noted the dinner order and executed flawlessly.  And checked back on us just the right number of times to be appreciated without being intrusive.  THANK YOU! \n\nI opted for a 10 oz ribeye, the smallest ribeye cut on the menu.  I asked for medium rare and that's exactly how it was prepared.  Piping hot and flavorful with a salty spice on the seared outside.  Deliciously juicy and tender.  An excellent steak, and just the right size.   Accompanied by creamed spinach, which was OK but nothing special. \n\nA house salad is included with the entree.  It's a garden salad.  Everything crisp and fresh, salad dressing in a cup on the side.  Dinner is accompanied by a basket of freshly baked rolls, atop a handful of crunch, house-made croutons.  \n\nEntrees here are well priced - the meal for 2 including 2 adult beverages was $55.  When you're in the mood for a quality steak meal at a reasonable price, Harold Seltzers is the place.","date":1625797558000}

We waited for our food for over 40 mins, and were told it was our chicken taking the time! But the chicken came out way over cooked and cold?! Asked for our plates to be cleared from our apps before the dinner platwaiter gave us attitude and told us to wait. \n\nWe talked to the manager, who made excuses and said she will take care of everything.

The menu, which changes semi-seasonally, has been thoughtfully selected and paired - and all ingredients are fresh, and organic - very high quality.

When I was a young teenager back in the day, Old Man Greenman was a genius. It was the best hoagie (I think) money can buy. I'm talking about the late 70's. Everyone from me & my friends from Holmesburg would ride our bikes or drive there as often as we could ~ to get their hoagie.\n    As time went on, the \"Old Man\" was getting up there in age & he decided it was time to pass the tourch down to his kids to run the buisness. Yes~They ran it~ they ran it right into the ground. Back then, you got a ton of meats' on it & it overflowed with meat like heaven. You could barely fit your mouth around it. I went back not that long ago, & much to my dismay, the roll had gotten shorter, the quality of the roll was no longer there. The amount of meat was cut down by about 60%. I said to the guy, What the hell is this? I paid for the over-priced little hoagie which I really didn't want now but I didn't want to cause a scene. So, I paid for it & left & never returned again. It tasted similar to a WaWa hoagie. That was the end of a great tradition.","date":1310566540000}

Lots of cool history, but very, very overpriced. Don't expect your room to be cleaned and made up everyday as this isn't their policy anymore. I know this for a fact as when I called the front desk to ask why my room wasn't cleaned and serviced with basics; clean towels, coffee, water, toiletries and stuff. I was told every third day the maid will tend to your room. So I asked the front desk manager \"so you charge more and give less services?\" I was astonished when she said \"yes, that's exactly what we do\". Unbelievable! as told by the front desk manager; \"we were hit hard by COVID\". We paid $700. per night and had to fend for ourselves for room necessities and basics. The reason people stay at expensive hotels is to experience great service and clean rooms. Not in season and seeing the parking lot late at night, it was about a quarter full showing the hotel was definitely not full. Again, It seems the COVID excuse is being taken advantage of here, as I searched job opportunities in the area, there were NO ADS for the Don Cesar looking for help. so not only we're we overcharged, didn't receive the hotel service, we were lied to as well. With a busy pool bar, and one bartender he was also complaining as well! It seems as though the Don Cesar has joined in with corporate America in the \"Fleecing of America\" charging you more and giving you less! \u00a0The rooms are small, carpets are dirty, in need of an update and can use a thorough cleaning. To add insult to injury they charge $27. for self parking and $31. for valet, a very high price for parking. As a business owner myself, if you're short on staff you use who you have to get the jobs done to please your customers. If the chef is sick, the restaurant doesn't close, the owner or manager jumps in to fill the position. This hotel had plenty of managerial staff to roll up their sleeves, but they chose to be very adamant, gleeful and unsympathetic about their charging high prices for less services doing it with a smile! We traveled two hours plus south to Naples, FL where the Ritz Carlton Hotel and all the restaurants and bars we visited had an abundance of staff. If you're visiting the St. Pete's Beach area, you'll be much better off at either a Airbnb or a chain hotel.","date":1636472429000}

I spent about $13 for their trio option where I got a cup of soup, fresh fruit, and a scoop of chicken salad. They also give you a pickle, a generous amount of wheat thin crackers, and a complimentary buttercream cookie with your order as well. \n\nOverall, I love it. Their chicken salad is amazing and I love their soup of the day options. Their chicken salad is always fresh and I love how many extras you get with your order. Def a fav spot for me when I want something on the healthier side!","date":1567546193000}

Already looking forward to my next visit to Silk City! Decent street parking, indoor and outdoor seating, and fresh ingredients make for a happy bruncher. \n\nI'm a sucker for a late brunch, and breakfast items are served until 3:30 pm on Saturdays and Sundays. I came here with a friend who suggested Silk City based on a previous visit. She raved about their breakfast sandwich. I was hesitant to order a breakfast sandwich, something I could easily get for $2 at McDonald's, but she was persuasive enough to convince me. I'm so glad she did! We sipped on our La Colombe coffee, served by our enthusiastic server, and only waited about 10 minutes or less for our meals. The croissant came with bacon, an over easy fried egg, avocado, a garlicky\/ buttery aioli spread, and fresh tomatoes. The croissant was perfectly flaky and soft, and all the ingredients tasted fresh. It's a simple dish, but it was very tasty. I also have to RAVE about their homefries that came with the sandwich. Crunchy fried sliced potatoes - perfectly salted and delicious - maybe the best part of the meal.\n\nThe missing star is for a few random, small complaints. One being that we waited for about ten minutes to be acknowledged by staff when we entered the restaurant. We awkwardly lingered in the cramped entrance unsure of whether or not to seat ourselves. I caught eyes with several busboys and servers, but none of whom even said hello. When we were finally greeted, we opted to sit outside. We were warned that the table available was in the sun, but it would have been an easy fix to adjust the umbrella. Fortunately, a shadier table opened up and we were able to move. Our new table sat facing the street, and at one point, we had a homeless person come up and ask us for bus fare. Our table's server was as nice as could be, but I couldn't help but notice most of the staff running around in extra casual clothing. One of the servers was bra-less and wearing a very revealing shirt. I'm all for a hipster ambiance, but I'm a little turned off by someone serving me food in a crop top - surely that's a health code violation?\n\nAll that too say, those minor things were not enough to turn me off. I'm keen to come back and try more menu items.","date":1497376974000}

Everyone kept raving about Seither's. Oh My Tastebuds! They are STILL tingling! \n\nThis menu is by far one of the most creative menus I've seen. We started by asking the Chef\/Owner to make us an appetizer. His creation was Fried Green Tomatoes with Boiled Shrimp Seared Tuna with Spicy Mayo and Eel Sauce. Please understand first and foremost while his food IS art the sauces were well thought out to enhance the flavor of the food and should be used! Here is another culinary confession, to be such a self proclaimed foodie I normally ask for my tuna to be cooked through. I realize all you chefs and food critics are now cringing but keep reading. It was velvety and buttery it was so mild and had a faint taste of the ocean. My husband and I fought over the last piece which is when I knew my entree choice. The Fried Green Tomatoes oh oh oh! The batter stayed firmly in place even when cut with a fork and no sign of grease anywhere! The boiled shrimp were seasoned to perfection! The avocados were perfectly ripe.\n\nOur entrees were the Volcano and Totem Pole. Until you have these you cannot possibly fathom happiness. I decided on the Volcano because of its beautiful tuna but the enormous dollop of snow crab salad is absolute heaven. There is a surprise of more perfectly seasoned boiled shrimp inside of the inverted DEEP FRIED taco shell. I don't know why but somehow I thought this surprise was a lagniappe of sorts so by definition small. No! It was a serious handful. All this edible art sits on a bed of shredded lettuce and there is more Spicy Mayo more Eel Sauce plus Sriracha! Do you know how hard it is to find a place that serves well ripened avocados in their dishes that serve it? Look no further many of Seither's dishes have avocados and it's clear they have standards regarding their ingredients. The Totem Pole. WOW. I had to tell my husband to slow down he looked like he just came off a 30 day fast. It's a fat, juicy seasoned and fried perfectly soft shell crab which is topped with slices of gorgeous fried eggplant as if that weren't enough there is crabmeat dressing I'm surprised held together because it's crammed with sweet blue crab. Speared through the top is a skewer with yep you guessed it MORE seafood. Saut\u00e9ed Shrimp. All of this happiness is slathered in cream sauce and dusted with parmesan cheese. \n\nWe were so full we needed boxes so we didn't order dessert but our amazing server Ruby came out of the kitchen with a boxed up gift from Jason Seither - wait for it- Deep Fried Upside Down Pineapple Bread Pudding!!!  and it was WARM!  My husband and I chatted as we left how we will have to try it tonight because we can't possibly eat another bite. Full disclosure the smell was amazing and we are currently eating it with our fingers on the ride home and it is to die for!! It's rich and gorgeous the pineapple is the star and deep frying it makes this textural happy place that will brighten even the darkest day!\n\nLastly I want to talk to my north shore folks. I thought Harahan? Really? Dang that's far! It was an easy drive from Causeway to Jefferson Hwy and so worth it. Go, go, GO!!!!!","date":1533665374000}

I'm no sushi connoisseur by any means, but I've eaten it long enough to know its not supposed to be cold. Who wants to eat cold, raw fish and rice? On top of that, they just did not taste well. I've had those same two rolls many times over at many different places and would say those were the worse I've ever had from anywhere else. I didn't even eat half of my order, not because I wasn't hungry but because it wasn't good.

I don't think it's as good as other burgers I've had, and I would have probably liked it more if they had melted cheese a little rather than just putting a slice of cold American cheese on the burger. The crinkle fries were good and the turtle concrete was pretty amazing.

Such a shame because I wanted to really like this place. On top of that, the owner I ptesume had what I call selective customer appreciation.,meaning every cordial experience extended to guest in front me, was not extended to me. It also took 25 min to get a veggie sandwich with no sandwich orders before me...really? They're also feeble on recalling your order. I asked for a pastry and to no avail, the absent minded cashier, didn't oblige my wishes. The hostess was the busiest and friendliest in the whole place.

The decor is nice and the service was good,  We went for breakfast and I had the Southern Q, which is the pulled pork on cornbread topped with poached eggs and hollandaise.  The pork is crisp on the outside, tender inside and the eggs perfectly cooked.  David had the brioche french toast and enjoyed it very much.  I took off 2 stars because the side of cheese grits I ordered was cold and despite a strange orange color, had no taste of cheese.  We also ordered sides of Berkshire bacon (delicious) and Shane-made sausage patties which came undercooked and too salty.\nWe were a little disappointed that the menu didn't include the fantastic andouille hash that they had on the menu at the Fat Hen when it was on Veterans Blvd.  (It's not on the menu at the Harahan location either.)\nThe tiny \"grocery\" in the back was laughable with $10 jars of blueberry jam and $5 jars of Tabasco steak sauce.\nI also thought $48 for 2 for breakfast was overpriced.

It was cold and we needed somewhere else to go. \n\n\"Oh\" my friend said, \"Look, some people came out of Chick's\". \n\n\"But Chicks is closed\"\n\n\"What is that place? There is no sign or anything...\"\n\nSo , we went in. We found a very cozy tavern type place and we sat down at a booth. Soon enough a pleasant server came over and gave us some menus and told us they had just opened about a month ago. \n\nThere was no name on the menu either, but at the bottom was the name of the chef : Paul Lyons. I recognized the name, googled it and remembered that he was the chef at Barbuzzo. \n\n\"Oh, this may be pretty good\" said I.\n\nI was correct. \n\nThe food was quite impressive. It is kind of a Mediterranean thing with French influences. We had a bunch of plates (all appetizer sized) : \n\nSocca : A+, the bread things were amazing and the Ratatouille (ahh, so that's what it is) was awesome!\nBrussel Sprouts : Also quite good. The preperation is less burned than most and one would think that would be a bad thing but this worked. This plate I will order many more times in the future.\nOctopus : This was a great dish, made even better by the Skate Balls (the best thing I ate all night.. more please!)\nEggplant : Tasty ... I didn't have much of this since my friends shared it till it was gone\nStuffed Bell Pepper : My friend loved that this was only $8.. Apparently a very good deal.  I liked it, but not as much as the other plates\n\nFrench Dip  : This was more of a full entree size and it was a bit of a let down after all of the other plates. It wasn't bad at all but it wasn't special in any way except the Ciabatta bread. Otherwise it was kind of cheezesteak like.\n\nFor dessert I got this amazing chocolate thing. I forget the name but it was not unlike the thing you desire at barbuzzo (I forget that name too).\n\nOverall it was quite good. The service was really friendly but a bit slow.

The ambiance was romantic and comfortable (right down to the furniture) and the service was prompt and (mostly) helpful but unobtrusive.\n\nThe food is good. Nothing mind-blowing here, but solid. I ate a six-course fixed menu for Valentine's Day and was alternately indifferent and impressed. The tomato basil \"pistou\" was essentially a minestrone; I didn't enjoy the chunky texture and could have used a creamy accoutrement. The bread rolls were schmeh and I suppose it's one of those background things but details say a lot about overall direction in menu. I don't like eating seafood in Alberta: it comes from too far away. Not that Madison's billets itself as a localvore haunt but considering the category (I'd say it's bordering on fine) and price, you'd expect there to be something that pops out. \n\nThe beef and salad courses were fantastic. All the flavours and ingredients were well balanced and executed well. I also enjoyed the sablefish, even though I know it came from faraway. But I couldn't get behind the other seafood courses and feel that Alberta has a lot to offer in terms of meat options. \n\nThe only knock I have on the service was the wine recommendation. I asked for something fruity but not \"in your face, like Australian shiraz\". We were served a French _____ (sorry, can't remember the region) and it started off pleasantly enough (light, aromatic fruit, zippy acidity) but as it had a chance to decant, it became downright sour, almost vinegary. Not the nicest last few sips. \n\nI will probably go back but due to the cost, not anytime soon. So close Edmonton, so close.","date":1297902522000}

Without hesitation, she apologized and politely offered to take it back.

Shortly afterward, I was approached by the manager and found myself having to justify my (solicited) critique of the $26 over-cooked catch of the day. The manager repeatedly explained that she couldn't serve fish undercooked. I repeatedly explained that I simply wanted it correctly cooked. The replaced fish was done perfectly but the overall experience was degraded by having to justify my dissatisfaction to the overly defensive manager.

I started going there for their pizza, which is very good and unique. When I started drinking, this was always my top spot on campus to go. While the prices are a bit high, there is a great selection of alcohol and the female bartenders are normally friendly and attractive. The juke box has something for everyone, including a good selection of heavy metal and rock music for people like me who are sick of the typical rap and RnB songs that are too common in the city. My main complaint about Maxi's is their pricing, which is a bit high. But on the other hand, they do have great Happy Hour specials. The other complaint is that the bar can be quite a bro fest, which is a turn off, but is expected at a campus. Either way, this is a staple of Temple University campus life as others have said and I would like to stop by when I'm in Philadelphia again.","date":1346045310000}

Each participant also has to rent shoes for an additional price of $3.50pp.  This is insane!!!\n\nThough i felt i was being robbed at gunpoint with these prices, we promised the kids a fun night so I decided to rent a lane anyway. They only had VIP lanes available to rent... but there was a 45 minute wait for a lane. We could literally see that the lanes weren't full. They had some weird excuse about their being only one employee who could rent out the lanes and that person wasnt available at the moment. What????\n\nSo plan B, we got the kids play cards so they could enjoy some arcade games while the adults waited at the bar. The games averaged $1 each with the least expensive being $0.25 and the most expensive being a VR game for $5. You preload the funds to play on a game card via a touch screen kiosk which also charges u $1 to print the card out. (insert eye roll here)\n\nThe bar didn't have a cocktail menu and typically when this happens, I'll ask the bartender what is their best drink they personally make... the bartender on duty apparently didn't have one... red flag!

The new building is so much nicer than the old one (which is just behind the new one) and I've never been to a place with a prettier bathroom. The sink in the women's restroom is a work of art.\n\nThe food is really good. REALLY good. I love the Padd Thai and I've had it with chicken and with shrimp. I've had other things on the menu but I always seem to gravitate back to that. The portions are generous, I usually have enough left over for lunch the next day and it reheats well. (The shrimp not so much, but that's to be expected with seafood in general I think.) \n\nThey have 5 levels of heat here: Mild, Medium, Hot, Extra Hot, or Thai Hot. I'm a heat lover, I put jalapenos and rooster hot sauce on everything. However I know when I'm out of my league and anything hotter than 'hot' here is too much for me and sometimes I just play it safe and order my dish 'medium'. I want to be able to taste my food and enjoy it, not destroy my taste-buds. FYI, if you order something 'hot' or hotter they state on the menu that they won't issue a refund.\n\nThe kids menu is pretty limited, fried rice or chicken fingers, so if you have picky eaters it's probably best to leave them at home. The service can be hit or miss, but it seems to be more an issue with under-staffing rather than inattentiveness.","date":1320238052000}

There was only other one patron inside on a Saturday at 9am, but the donuts looked as pretty as ever. I paid $7.25 for the two (one cake-style, one filled) and while this is the going rate for a dozen at the typical donut shop, these should not be included within that same echelon. Rather, I'd compare these confections with the artisan pastries you'd find at your local bakery or coffeehouse. \n\nBoth donuts were very good. The browned butter had the perfect sweet\/savory combination, and the eggnog creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was perfectly crisped on the outer shell just like the real deal. The eggnog filling was particularly tasty as well. \n\nWill this spot last in Santa Barbara? I sure hope so.

It's set at an angle drawing your eye straight down the shotgun layout, but you can't miss the bar.

Make this the start of your delicious night on the town. The Blackened Tilapia Tacos, Cajun Rub Tuna Steak or if you're feeling cheesy, the BYO Quattro Formaggio would be a really great follow up options. Trust my recommendations, folks.

Thank God I had two Groupons, because it would have been super expensive. \nThe good: 1. My nieces loved the go karts-the older one (7) got to drive her own. They have two speeds-slow or fast. The younger one (4) and I also rode double (I drove) in a slow one. I think you have to be 48\" tall to drive your own. Not sure of how tall for the fast ones. 2. Good game selection. Also had bumper cars and a few other small \"ride\" type things and laser tag. 3. Lots of seating.  4. It was a good 2.5 hours of entertainment. \n\nThe bad: 1. The food. Not of the best quality. The buffet is mostly pizza and pasta. There was a separate salad bar and dessert bar. 2. Expensive. I had two groupons that equaled $50. This paid for our food and plenty of time for playing games (but this was only for two kids). HOWEVER, the bumper cars and go karts, etc, cost more money. HOWEVER, I accidently didn't pay for the go-karts. Seriously accidental. I didn't see the thing to swipe your card-no staff member was standing there. I honestly thought we would swipe it just before we got on. Nope. I got a $15 freeby. Oopsie. 3. The people sitting outside smoking. The benches were lined with older people, who obviously were not there with children(Mostly elderly),  who had apparently partaken (is that a word?) of the $9.99 \"All You Can Eat\" buffet. It was wonderful to think that all the kids entering were walking through their cloud of smoke.  4. The type of clientele. I found many people to be rude. Mostly in the dining room. The dining room is set up with rooms in themes, and lots of people have birthday parties there. At one point, some people saw me standing there trying to get through-they were between tables standing up and talking, and I had to walk around to get to my nieces. Like go out, walk around the whole room and come in another entrance. Also lots of kids running. \n\nIn the medium category: 1. Lots of staff people. I saw multiple people going by with mop buckets. I kept wondering if there were that many kids vomitting or what. Also, I instructed the elder niece to sit at the table while I took her sister to the restroom. Of course, she is 7 and can't follow those types of instructions. I come out of the bathroom and she is getting another plate of food. We go back to the table, and it is all bussed away. Everything. I was a bit bitter about my salad, but I guess with it being mostly kid clientele, there are used to lots of food getting wasted, and probably thought we were done. We had literally just sat down. \n\n\n\nIn conclusion, go if you have a groupon. I don't think I could afford to go if I did not. And yes, I realize that it is expected that lots of kids will be there, but I also expect manners out of kids, regardless of where they are. Oh, and out of adults too.","date":1382119055000}

For my entree, I shared the Diavola pizza; I was blown away. The crust was chewy like an authentic Italian pizza, and the outside of it was slightly crispy and bubbly. Fresh out of the wood fired oven! The red sauce was very good, and in my opinion, it was the mozzarella that stole the show. It was so fresh, flavorful, and creamy. I could have eaten the mozzarella just by itself, especially after it was cooked in the wood oven. The pepadew peppers and pepperonis really complemented the flavors in the pizza as well. The finishing touch was the basil - so flavorful and fresh as well!\n\nThe table shared tiramisu for dessert. Great flavor and was light and fluffy; I would get this again too!

The decor and atmosphere is superb.I would consider ourselves very experienced when it comes to Japanese cuisine. OK, ownership isn't Japanese but from what we know the head chef is. That's important since so many places that boast themselves as Japanese or serving Japanese food are not Japanese owned nor do they have Japanese chefs. When we first started going they didn't offer sashimi. Now they do and it is very good. No driving into center city and having to pay for parking which now tops $20. \n\nService is usually very good though I would not say it is consistent. We have high expectations not only for food and atmosphere but service too when paying a premium. I say premium in the context of Azie because it is on the high side of the scale for dining in Media. I don't mind paying a premium when all three aspects of my rating system are met or exceeded. \n\nTry Azie if you want to get good food in a hip place that is local and raising the bar for the restaurant scene in the Media area. Most other places around here are corporate chains with mediocre food or independent places that serve food that is just good enough to get by. \n\nWhat can be done to improve Azie? All that need be done is a slight improvement in prompt service, a few more smiles from hostesses, servers and waitstaff and recognition of return customers and this place will get 5 stars from me.

If you work downtown and want a quick in-and-out lunch, forget it.  Expect to spend at least $20 for lunch with drink, tax, and tip.  The lunch food is really good, they can really put together a sandwich and a bowl of soup.  But so can a dozen other places in half the time for nearly half the price.  So I'm not quite sure what lunch crowd they're gunning for here.  Business execs from out of town?  Young couples with the afternoon off?  Rich families here on vacation?  I mean, staring at Citygarden for an hour is fun, but not THAT fun, ya know?  There's only so many times I can look at the statue of that lady falling before my stomach (and wallet) tells me I should have gone to Breadco.\n\nAs far as dinner is concerned, I don't even know where to start.  I walked in a little before 6 on a Saturday.  The place has about 15 tables, and exactly 2 of them are occupied.  No problem, right?  When I say I don't have a reservation, you'd think I just told them a nuclear bomb is headed their way.  After I get accosted for not having a reservation and told there would be \"at least a 2 hour wait\" (I was more puzzled than upset), they said they could squeeze me in because they had a cancellation.  Oh thank you so much for making room for me at this empty restaurant!  Needless to say at no point during the rest of my meal was the restaurant even close to being occupied, and even on our way out (the busiest part of the evening), there were still 2-4 empty tables.  At various points during the evening I saw the hostess furiously working on the reservation book.  Come on guys, it shouldn't be this hard.  I could have handled the logistics of a 15 table restaurant when I was in grade school.\n\nAlso, can we officially declare a moratorium on using sheets of paper as tablecloths?  There are WAY too many upscale restaurants in St. Louis that do this, and it's starting to really annoy me.  What's the matter guys?  Doing an extra few loads of laundry every day is really going to break you?  Don't give me that \"going green\" crap, your restaurant is in a freaking glass box.  You know, the type that has no insulation and takes a small fortune to heat and cool?  You're not saving any trees with that setup, so don't give excuses why I feel like I'm eating at Macaroni Grill every time I sit down.  From now on, I think I'm just going to bring my own crayons and doodle on them as I wait.  To all the restaurants that do this, grow up guys.  I'm an adult.  If I'm dropping $30 for an entr\u00e9e, I deserve a real tablecloth.  End the papercloth oppression.\n\nFurthermore, if this is a nice restaurant, what's up with this chintzy furniture?  Is Jim Fiala's dad a metalsmith or something?  I feel like I'm sitting on the worst outdoor patio furniture in the world when I'm in here.  Cheap looking aluminum, easy to knock over, no padding, uncomfortable.  Did they run out of money after they bought the Niki de Saint Phalle sculpture?  Personally, I'd trade it in for some seat cushions.\n\nOh yeah so let's talk about the food.  This Jim Fiala guy is supposed to be a big deal in St. Louis.  He runs all these upscale restaurants, and he's like the \"new breed\" of contemporary chefs or something.  But as far as I can tell it's just the same old stuff in a new container.  The guy throws around some paprika and fennel and people think he's a genius.  Well let me tell you something folks, I subscribe to Cooking Light magazine, and I'm pretty sure the recipes I've made from there are just as good as the stuff I got at The Terrace View.  \n\nThe only thing I know about Fiala's restaurants is that they're all expensive places where the food never justifies the price tag.  And The Terrace View is no exception.  For $25 I got about a 4-5oz Pork Tenderloin with some cheesy potatoes and spinach.  The sauce was alright, not spectacular.  The person I was with had the $26 salmon with umm, I think it was just salmon.  With some kind of crazy butter sauce.  At least I think it was butter sauce.  That's all I tasted anyway.  The salmon was good, I think...I don't know, is salmon supposed to taste like butter?\n\nSo at the end of the night I dropped about $80 for what I would consider a meal worth about half that much.  The food was alright, the service was alright, everything was alright except the bill...and the stuff I mentioned earlier.  So I guess my point is if you're going to overcharge people for food, at least make it seem like you're not ripping them off.  Give them real tablecloths and comfortable seats to sit on, and don't act like WWIII hit just because you walk in without a reservation.  Seems like the cult of Fiala has kind of overgrown the quality of the dishes, which is a shame because a park as awesome as Citygarden deserves an equally awesome place to eat.","date":1303748127000}

I decided on the fried chicken sandwich, which came with avocado, and topped with a spicy mayo.  I believe this was also a special sandwich for the night.  We also order a couple sides of fries to split for the table.  This sandwich was delicious.  The chicken was oh so nice and crispy and perfectly fried.  The flavor just made my mouth water and enjoy every bight.  It was nice and spicy too. Just the way I like it.\n\nWhen we got our checks the waitress said she took $2 off because mine came out late.

All eight of us in the group I went with stuffed ourselves until we couldn't eat anymore, and everyone had at least seconds and thirds of each dish. The rice is plentiful, service attentive and friendly, and prices totally reasonable.\n\nThe spicy crispy cucumber is fresh, light, and full of flavor. The cold sesame noodles were delicious, but the best noodles were the dan dan noodles (hot, aromatic, nutty, spicy). The beef tripe was spicy and had a nice peanut flavor, but the tripe idea kind of weirds me out and there was a slightly rancid undertone to that dish. We then got double cooked style pork belly, cumin style beef, and my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE (I could have eaten this non-stop all night) 3 cup chicken. \n\nI highly recommend this restaurant, I'd come back here in an instant with just another person, it's worth it!

Pangolin Caf\u00e9 is adorable. \n\nI tried to visit last year, but the hours I attempted to never lined up with the hours they were open. I am so glad I persevered! \n\nI wanted to try every item from the menu, but in the short week that I was visiting, I sampled a few things:\n1. Visit 1: The cardamom latte is amazing! If you're a fan of this flavor, I highly recommend it. The cardamom is not overpowering, but it's not too subtle either. At this visit, I learned that you receive a sample of a Turkish delight made in-house. I chose the pistachio to start with! The delights are starch-based and so good!\n2. Visit 2: The matcha latte with oat milk (not pictured) was seriously one of the best-made matcha lattes I've ever had-- no clumps and no awful sweeteners! If you're a matcha fan, Pangolin is a hidden gem. This time, I tried a Hawaiian Turkish delight after the staff recommended it, and I found my favorite (also great for macadamia nut lovers)!\n3. Visit 3: A classic vanilla oat milk latte doesn't hurt anybody! My mom was with me this time; she's not a big coffee\/tea drinker, so she opted for the rose-lavender lemonade. It's not a traditional lemonade (i.e. not a lot of lemon flavor), so it was definitely new for my mom. It is delicious though! The Hawaiian Turkish delight train chugged along. \n4. Visit 4: I love tea lattes and the Manoa was a wonderfully refreshing (not pictured). I substituted the coconut milk for oat milk and made the drink iced and it was so good! I will say that the Manoa is all about subtle flavors so if you're looking for strong, bold flavors, this is not the drink for you. This time, they were out of Hawaiian, so I opted for Rose-- a blast of rose flavor after some chewing and tastes exactly as labeled!\n\nAt the end of the day, Pangolin Caf\u00e9 does not only house unique, delicious flavors, but also houses a friendly staff that goes above and beyond for its customers and community! When my friend asked specifically for Oatly instead of the Pacifica oat milk, they hopped into the back and found some to use just for our orders. \n\nThanks again Pangolin Caf\u00e9 and staff! I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town!","date":1624575910000}

We arrived at the Il Ritorno at 6:45 and didn't receive our appetizers until at least 8:00pm. After another hour we received our lukewarm underwhelming entrees at around 9pm. To her credit, our waitress tried her absolute best to mitigate our growing agitation and assuage an increasingly frustrated group of guests. However, the manager of the restaurant, rather than apologizing for the poor service simply placed two of the past due entrees in front of two of our party members and then promptly left.\n\nSo, here's the deal, shitty service is bad enough, but our entrees were not even close to worth the wait. I get that sometimes kitchens get backed up and things happen, but you can mitigate these issues with a simple apology and\/or comping part of a meal (if the failure was indeed on the restaurants end).\n\nThe outcome of our experience will simply be this: None of the members of our party will ever eat at Il Ritorno again (a bit ironic given the name of the restaurant) and none of us will recommend it to anyone we know. \n\nOh yeah and our bill was $520 including tip for 8 people.

We ordered:\n\n-Vegetable Samosas x2:  These were a good size, cooked well, and had a great filing.  Two pieces per order, so we got two orders.\n-Paneer Tikka Masala: Sauce was great, but there was not a lot of paneer for an entree.\n-Channa Masala: Really nicely spiced, and a good portion size.\n-Chicken Makhani:  Again a delicious sauce, but the amount of chicken was lacking.\n-Garlic Naan x2:  Delicious!  Warm and fluffy with an intoxicating garlic smell that almost made me rip into the bag on the way home.  Definitely recommend getting two orders for 3 people.\nWe received three nice containers of rice on the side.\nNext time I'd like to try their Kati rolls as the pictures look mouth-watering!\n\nService was friendly and food was ready on-time.\n\nOverall I thought everything had good flavors and the quality was good.  However, I felt the portion sizes for the entrees were not up to par.  We each got a few pieces of chicken and paneer and then were left with an abundance of sauce.  And extra sauce is great!  But for the amount of food we ordered I expected to have more protein in the entrees (especially the paneer) and be a little fuller by the end of the meal.

I'm extremely picky with breakfast restaurants since it's so easy to make, however it's also easy to make it poorly. The only thing that is unfortunate is that their coffee is extremely watered down. I'm positive they don't use enough coffee grounds and possibly even reuse grounds. I recommend bringing your own coffee if you are an actual coffee drinker. I mean what's a great breakfast without decent coffee? Other than bringing my own coffee, I absolutely love the food.","date":1564966830000}

I've been here on other occasions and we knew what to expect - included gratuity, fixed menu, group seating with other guests.\n\nI'll start with our chef - I believe his name was Richie. Chef Richie was VERY entertaining. Enthusiastically telling jokes, engaging our table, and giving off a great vibe. It was a pleasure to sit with him, honestly the beat chef I've ever had at a hibachi restaurant. I had initially thought to give a three star review, but our chef was so great I had to give four.\n\nThe food was about what I expected. The salad dressing was very good, and the appetizers were just okay. My spicy tuna roll tasted a bit off and the color looked a little different than I'm used to seeing. I did not get sick but I will steer clear of the sushi next time. My fiance had the yakitori - overcooked chicken on skewers, topped with sauce.\n\nThe fried rice was absolutely delicious as always, best part of the meal. My fianc\u00e9 and I both ordered chicken and steak, which were served with onions, broccoli, and zucchini. My steak was ordered medium rare and came out overcooked, but not horribly so. However, to our chef's credit, he did take extra care to cook the steaks correctly, searing them on each side and setting them on the cooler portion of the grill until he had cooked all of the other meat and veggies, when he resumed cooking them in order to devote his full attention to them. I did not see the other chefs doing this, so I appreciate his effort.\n\nIf my review of the food sounds harsh, I will say again - this is about what I expected. Given that the restaurant places a large emphasis on entertainment, I didn't expect to be served the most delicious food I've ever eaten. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. I took my leftovers home and enjoyed them the following day.\n\nI will add that the restaurant was also very cold - not great considering it was a very cold day to begin with, and honestly it was as though the lobby and seating away from the grill area were not heated at all. We both ordered hot tea but unfortunately had to pay extra for them as they were not included in the fixed holiday menu - bummer. The meal itself was filling but I would call it a bit overpriced, especially because if we had been there for dinner, it would have been $60 per person for the same meal. Add to this, the parking was $15 and included a coupon for Dave & Buster's food only.\n\nIt was a fun thing to do for a special occasion. We see no reason not to return.","date":1455574958000}

We had the option to choose our own selections or allow the chef to select for us, and we preferred to be surprised. The first five plates came out quickly, starting with the Japanese scallop sashimi, the rice tuna cracker, and the shrimp tempura rolls. For robatayaki, we were served octopus and ribeye. I was mostly impressed by the rice tuna cracker. It was a simple piece of fried rice molded together into a \"cracker\" topped with spicy tuna. The texture and flavor were perfect and I could have probably eaten another dozen.\n\nWe had a nice break after the first five plates were served and then we were given the Japanese fried chicken and the edamame dumplings. I was least impressed with the fried chicken dish. While it tasted great and the batter was perfectly crispy, it was lacking the same amount of flavor that I expected after tasting the other dishes. For our final plates, we were served the broiled sea bass, the robatayaki hanger steak, and the crispy brussell sprouts. Of these, my favorite was the perfectly cooked seabass.\n\nOur meal was complete after mochi topped with a sparkler to celebrate our birthdays. We were served vanilla, salted caramel, and passion fruit. Overall, we were very satisfied with our meal.

Looking at the old photos on the walls with men wearing suits instead of cargo shorts and t-shirts speaks volumes.  Not that I'm dying to wear a suit in Florida's heat, but the romantic nature of the 40s thru the 60s makes me believe I was born several decades too late.  \n\nThis was my first go at parimutuel betting, and admittedly, it was a lot to soak in.  Dog weight, fastest recorded speed, kennel of origin, the dogs parents and how the dog finished based on its starting position are all important metrics when placing your bet--apparently.  I ran a few seemingly well thought out bets that didn't really pay off, so I just switched up my technique and began betting on my favorite numbers 1, 4 and 7.  Surprisingly, that's when I started winning.  I walked in with $40 to blow and left with $20, so I consider that a success, especially for my first go at it.\n\nWe sat in the grandstand balcony, right up front and with a perfect line of sight on the entire track.  The weather cooperated, and we mixed in a few pitchers of beer and some classy cigars to improve the mood.\n\nAfterwards, we went upstairs to the Circa 1925 restaurant and bar.  There were no menus though, only a buffet.  It's $15 during the manatee and $30 at night with the only difference being some seafood options at night.  It all looked really good, and our only regret was that we weren't hungry.  I did snap a few pics for good measure though. \n\nThis place has been around for nearly 100 years, and I hope it's around for another 100.  Derby Lanes is a true Florida classic establishment.","date":1487016373000}

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the food here at Silly Goose! It is a phenomenal combination of flavors in every bite. \n\nThe items I am talking about (which are the only ones I have had):\n\nThe zipper\nThe frisbee\nMexico City (this one is so-so)\nPomegranate Red Tea\nHerbed Cous Cous\n\nThe thing about Silly Goose is that the space is super small and so you run into the typical issues, long wait times, space for a car seat, etc. so we typically do takeout and the food is still as wonderful when we get home.\n\nI guess my major problems with Silly Goose, that I would tell everyone just so they know, are:\n\n1. There is one specific girl that works there that can be incredibly rude and not very accommodating to her guests. She always seems to have somewhat of an attitude and no patience so I like to avoid going when she is there.\n\n2. They change their menu seasonally. This isn't such a bad thing, it's nice to see new things on the menu. But, sometimes they take the stuff you love off the menu AND BE SURE TO READ DESCRIPTION OF WHATEVER YOU NORMALLY ORDER because it too can change. (hence the incident with the server. I always ordered The Frisbee and it use to come on deliciously fluffy focaccia bread. Well, when the menu changed the bread for that sandwich did too and I didn't bother to read the description b\/c that is what I always ordered. I asked the server if I could get it on that bread and that I apologize that I didn't notice that it changed to flaxseed. Instead of saying \"no problem, let me get that switched for you.\" I was told that it now came on flaxseed and that I needed to read the menu. She eventually changed it for me.)\n\n3. When you pay with a credit card, you use their iPad which, unlike when they first opened you could choose your dollar amount for a tip, now only gives you the option of 15% or more. To me that is very presumptive. Most of the time I tip 20% or more, but on my to-go orders I typically only do 10% (perhaps I should reconsider?) but because of this set up, I now don't tip at all. That may be horrible of me but after working in the restaurant industry for several years, togo's typically do not require much from the server and so I feel like 10% is a fair amount.\n\nAll-in-all, don't let my 3 negatives deter you from visiting. They were just FYI. Silly Goose is ultimately some of the best food you will eat and I am glad it is right around the corner. :)","date":1328815478000}

It's south across the street from Target so it has been convenient for me while I'm getting organized. Both times it's been exactly what I thought it would be and just what I needed.\nNico's is in a strip mall with plenty of parking in the front. The seating area is generous with 6 or 7 tables. There is nothing special here either but it's clean. Pick a spot, the menu is on the wall and place your order at the window, then pick it up at the window when your order is ready, It's like business. The kitchen is friendly is you strike up a conversation just waiting. You have a choice of red sauce or green. I like the green better because it's spicier. We all know spice is the spice of life.\nThe food is hot and delicious. Everything that I have ordered came with Mexican rice and beans. It's a meal. I can't give the 5th star because of the ambiance or lack of but for lunch, this place is a munch!\nSo I recommend Nico's and I plan to return even if I don't need anything from Target.","date":1560460717000}

I got the filet mug on, he got the Chilean sea Bass, both of which were such good quality and were absolutely delicious. I ordered the pear martini which was so flavorful. The reason I am giving this 3 stars is because of the service. We sat down at 6:45, without a drink menu which we were about to ask our server for. After 10 minutes she approaches the table and asks us if we would like a drink, we then asked for the drink menu. She brings it to us and does not come back for 15 minutes, at which point we had to stop her from leaving so we could put in an appetizer. The first thing we got was our appetizer, then our cocktails came about 10 minutes after we ordered it, almost 25 minutes after we sat down. The service just kept going like this, so much we spent about 2 hours there simply because she very rarely stopped by the table. As a server myself I would never give that kind of service and was very disappointed in such a supposedly upscale restaurant.","date":1478027311000}

It is a French boutique style hotel, which means it looks really cool, but in the end is fairly small. The staff is excellent and on top of things, and the courtyard by the pool is a really neat touch. \nCons: The bathroom looks nice upon first examination, but is small and could use an engineering update; the door must remain locked or else it's going to hit you in the behind as it swings open by default while you stand in front of the mirror. Also, if you are a SPG member and they offer you 250 points for the \"Green Option\" where they don't change out your towels, don't go for it.

The first time I went, it was for dinner. I had the black bean burger and it tasted like nothing. Not good, not bad, but it was flavorless. I've had better luck with the Morningstar black bean burgers in the frozen food section at Publix. Anyway, fast forward to today. I decided to give this place one more shot, considering how much hype there was on here about the brunch buffet. I wish I hadn't...\n\nSo we were seated and informed that the brunch buffet was $19 per person. That seems high, even for good food. But, whatever, I thought. If it's great food it isn't too big of a deal. Well, it wasn't great food. I started off with some chicken and waffles and fruit. The fruit was okay (though, my companions later told me that they each got a sour piece that turned them, and me, off of the fruit totally), and the chicken was very average but edible. That leads me to the waffles, which were tough and flavorless. They were the worst waffles I have ever had. When we were sat, originally, the server informed us that if we wanted a waffle or omelette made for us individually it is included and to just ask. However, our server didn't come back to our table until it was time for the check. Given my experiences at this restaurant, I doubt the \"specially made\" waffle or omelette would be much better than what was put out.\n\nConsidering the sour fruit, I decided against trying anything with egg or the lox, since it was left out and could cause gastrointestinal problems (based on the sourness of the fruit, I wasn't taking any chances). So I tried a few more things, but it was largely the same experience. The food didn't taste particularly good, regardless of what I got. The biscuits and chicken were the more edible, as I found myself torn between wanting to stop altogether and wanting to get my money's worth. I ended up somewhere in the middle, largely unsatisfied. \n\nThis place should be one of the restaurants that charge maybe $12 per buffet, but I still wouldn't go. What's the point of going out for a meal with friends if the food is going to ruin it? Typically, bad dining experiences can be managed if you are out with people you love. But it was hard to enjoy even that considering the owner\/cook was arrogantly bragging about how great her food is and how it's a \"science.\" It was classless and, worst of all, totally inaccurate. Anyway, I would suggest against going here. I've gone to several places in the area that have much better breakfast, and if the black bean burger is any indicator of their dinner, I'd stay away from that too. \n\nHighlights: tasteless\/sour food, overpriced, delusional owner. I really wanted to like it here, and I'm trying not to be rude, but my Sunday morning was ruined here and I'll never be back.","date":1446397054000}

I have visited multiple times, hoping that it would become as advertised. My friends and I will no longer waste our hard earned gas money to make the trek.\nThe place started out with a bang, lots of excitement and things going on. Although there were some growing pains, the food was always good and the place was hopping. The service and management though, was, and still is, indifferent to useless. We have yet to witness any hot rods coming to life as advertised. It seems every time we have gone to lunch the entire shop staff is up at the bar and at dinner they have taken over the center of the dining room, so I can see why nothing is done in the shop. Are these guys just actors playing a role?? \nBack to the food, since it is a restaurant. My friends and I thought it was pretty darn good at the start. A few glitches, but they seemed more service related than kitchen problems. Then something happened around October-November....everything just went in the toilet. Nobody in the place, yet still a 40 minute to an hour wait for food, cold food, presentation awful, tastes old and stale, out of many items and staff didn't seem to know until the rest of the food was on the table, the list goes on. Even the silverware, glasses, and plates look dirty. Service still in a fog. Seems they just like to wait on their friends or stand around looking and talking. The management truly doesn't seem to know what they were doing. We had the pleasure (misfortune) of meeting the owner one time. This is obviously where the whole vibe comes from; he was sloppy, rude, and indifferent to what we had to say. \nI don't see anything that would make me ever return to this place as it is now.","date":1367947118000}

They also have an impressive list of vegetarian rolls, although I usually stick with the shitake or kanpyo variety.\n\nSadly, this place isn't perfect.  While I love the sushi, the hibachi is not the best I have ever had.  But my only real complaint is the slow service.  If you are ordering takeout, and they tell you 20 minutes, you had better give it at least 45 (and even then, it's usually not ready!).  They seem to frequently be short a staff person at the front desk, so you may be standing there for a while.  Finally, whatever you do, don't eat here when you're in a rush.

That's right it's good enough for profanity in all it's carnality.  Average, plate clocks in at about $8.

I ordered a taco salad because that's an easy way to compare one place to another. Plus, I was going right back to work and they would be quick. I received my chips and salsa with my drink and was sad to see how small a dish the salsa came in. I ate it all and would have liked more. My meal came quickly, as planned. The guacamole was so-so and simple. The meat was almost cold. I know a taco salad is a cool dish, but the meat should be somewhat warm so I know it was cooked properly at some point.  Overall, the dish was just ok. And since I had very little salsa to eat, I could not add any to this to give it any more taste. I finished my salsa, my meal and my drink without ever taking to my waiter again. I went to the bathroom and returned to no drink refill or check so I just made way to the cashier. Nobody their. I stood there 3 to 4 minutes waiting to pay. The cashier charged my for something I did not order or get and I had to go through the refund and another ring up. I really wish I did not leave a tip because there was no service other than to bring my food to me and that was the cook or another server, not even mine. \n\nMy overall assessment:  Love good salsa? Go there. Love good food and\/or good service? Go elsewhere. \n\nMy ranting: 4 star salsa, 1 star service and 2 star food means 2.3 stars in my book. \n\nThis story is over, and it ends sadly.

I've haven't had good ginger chicken and ong Choi since my fathers cooking . This is pretty close to his . And their prices are much more reasonable than lucky Lou . This is much closer to my house so unless I'm getting roast duck , this is where I'll be coming from now. I grew up on authentic Cantonese cuisine and this is as close as it get in Indy . We ll def be back to try their other dishes . The owners  aren't Cantonese, they said they were from a city south of canton . Spoke a chinese dialect I couldn't understand , it's pretty amazing how many different Chinese dialect exists . Heck my grandparents speak a different dialect lol but all that matters is their cooking is good . I completely dismissed this place at first because of the Americanized bento menu that were catered to haoles. Order from the Chinese menu you won't regret it :)","date":1617749254000}

When friend and fellow blogger Megan (I Run For Wine), invited me to be part of a monthly get together over brunch, I was ecstatic.  Megan, along with these fabulous ladies: Katie (Ruffles & Truffles), Leslie (Dash of Les) and Rachel (Runners Tales) formed this group as a way to see who has the best brunch in the bay area. I adore every one of these girls and am very excited to be a part of this special group. \n\nOur first stop of the brunch tour was at South Tampa hot spot, Ciccio's. This was my first time having brunch there and I was anxious to sample their house specialties. Brunch is not brunch without a cocktail and we started off with their Ciccio Bloody Mary. Made from scratch with a nice amount of spice, it was a great way to start to my day. The bacon was a delicious bonus.\n\nOur first dish was their Tuscan Bowl. Ricotta blended scrambled eggs with fresh basil, vine ripe tomatoes and melted Parmesan, it was fantastic. This was the perfect dish for me in that it was incredibly tasty and high in protein. I would order this again in a heartbeat. Filled with flavor and packed with protein, this is a must-have at Ciccio's.\n\nNext up was their Turkey Club Bowl and this was another highlight of my meal. Made with scrambled eggs, roasted house-made turkey, sausage and avocado, this one knocks it out of the park in the flavor department. \n\nAs many of you know, I am a California Girl. I grew up eating tomatoes and avocados on a daily basis, so it was no surprise that I would enjoy our next selection, California Dreaming. Ciccio's did me proud with this dish that combines scrambled eggs, organic spinach, vine ripe tomatoes and fresh sliced avocado. Simply amazing, this also had farro at the bottom of the bowl.  All of their bowls can be served with your choice of farro or homefries. I love homefries but the farro really won me over. I think they should name this the \"Tracy Bowl.\" \n\nThe next dish we tried was my absolute favorite.  The Natural Chicken & Egg Sandwich Club is a heavenly creation of chicken, egg, avocado, bacon and garlic aioli on grilled sourdough bread. I seriously want to hug whoever created this masterpiece. The flavor combination of this sandwich is just sensational. I could have easily devoured the whole thing so thank goodness we were sharing. \n\nNext we tried the Lanza Burrito. A fantastic blend of scrambled eggs, homefries, bacon, black beans, cheddar and jack cheese sauce and then topped with avocado salsa, this breakfast burrito rocks.  I must say, Ciccio's won me over with this and I am happy that I found a place to cure my burrito craving in Tampa.\n\nAnother favorite of the day was the Big Chorizo Egg Wrap.  Eggs, chorizo, avocado and jack cheese all stuffed into your choice of a whole wheat or flour tortilla and paired with a Marsala or ketchup dipping sauce.  I really liked this and tried it with hot sauce. I love all things spicy and a nice hot sauce pairs well with the eggs and chorizo. Do not even get me started on the homefries. Like that famous brand of potato chips, nobody can eat just one.\n\nWas I full at this point? Heck yeah. Was I going to surrender my fork? No way! We had two types of pancakes to taste and I have never met a pancake that I didn't like. The first was their Oatmeal Pancakes which is a generous portion of three oatmeal pancakes with butter and maple syrup. Fantastic! \n\nOur final dish made me squeal with delight......Oatmeal Chocolate Chip and Strawberry Pancakes. These were like three fluffy pieces of heaven and the fresh strawberries made them really stand out. I became enamored with the flavor that was sweet yet not too overbearing. Growing up, I used to look forward to going to church on Sundays and then breakfast immediately after. My brother and I were obsessed with pancakes and would order different types and share. His favorite were always chocolate chip, so these really reminded me of my childhood. I know my son would devour these so it looks like a brunch trip to Ciccio's for the kiddos and I will be in the very near future.\n\nIf you are looking for a fantastic brunch experience with tons of tasty options, be sure to check out Ciccio's!","date":1362428189000}

We had a diverse group of about 14 people with many different tastes. I personally do not do sushi or spicy or seafood, and was worried about finding something to eat that would suffice. I ended up ordering the Black Pepper Ramen on the Chef's Special section. I got doubly worried when the waiter then warned me it wasn't really a \"broth based ramen\". Oh well, let's try it anyway. The rest of the group ordered various sushi, seafood, and land dishes. Oh, and several drinks. Such fancy drinks! We also had one group member with an allergy, and the chef didn't hesitate to throw together something customized based on other menu elements for them. As for the food, no one in our group had anything negative to say. On the menu, I personally can only review the Black Pepper Ramen. OMG!!! It was delicious!  Seriously, I need the recipe. If you love cracked black pepper (and eggs) like I do, you will loooove this dish. Our waiter so patient and attentive. I highly recommend this place. I believe parking is one of the only concerns.

I wasn't sure going in but the burger changed my mind.  Graffiti Junktion is set up on the corner of a strip mall area just below Fowler Ave on 56th street on the east side.  Parking is a common area for all the stores there but it didn't seem to be a problem here.  We went for lunch.  The bar area is set up so that you can sit at it on the outside of the place or on the inside.  Tables inside are arranged around the room.  TVs are plenty.  They have a set of different beers that are national and local breweries and some foreign beers as well.  It appeared both from the outside and inside as a typical beer\/burger joint, nothing more or less.  We had the zucchini fries for an appetizer.  They were a little better than okay.  My wife had the Mac Daddy which she enjoyed.  I had the Lone Star burger done medium with fries.  It was actually a very good burger.  The sauce was not overpowering.  The cheese and bacon added great flavor to the burger itself.  I would do this again!  I hate it when you go to one of those burger places and halfway through the burger, you're bun has given up.  You have no idea where it went, but whatever is leave on the burger has to be taken off and twisted dry.  Not here.  I really enjoyed this burger.\nService was there when you needed it, not there when you didn't.  I had two beers and they were on the table fairly quickly.  My wife, thinking she was getting a burger that was going to taste like a Big Mac, enjoyed the mac and cheese burger, saying if she had known what it was before, she wouldn't have ordered it.  However, now that she had it, she really liked it.  \n\nGoing back....sure.","date":1419626836000}

We tried the gemelli verde which had some mushroom in it and the pork ragout one. Seriously the pasta was the best I've ever had and I'm still having dreams about it.

The quality of the food was fantastic - there wasn't a dish that I didn't like - but for the rave reviews and the reputation that Amada has as being the place that does tapas the best, I was a little disappointed in a couple of the dishes.\n\nOur goal was to order roughly one dish in every category or so. The standouts, from among the ones that we ate, were the clams & chorizo (the sauce adds a very vibrant flavor to the seafood) and the pan-roasted barramundi, which was very buttery and fell apart when we ate it. The foie gras pate we had was good, but the apricots in the dish somewhat overpowered the other flavors. The salchichon was well-prepared, and I liked the aragones cheese dish as well. The one dish I was somewhat disappointed in was the lamb chops stuffed with goat cheese...there were plenty of times where I took a bite and there was much more (or all) cheese relative to the meat...so it tasted more like a mozzarella stick than anything else. We also had the braised pork shoulder flatbread, which was good but a bit on the salty side. We split a dessert, the caramalized dark chocolate custard, that was very well-done. The sorbet worked very well as a compliment to the custard.\n\nAll in all, there were a couple of standout dishes, but I felt like most of the dishes were fairly standard and didn't 'grab my attention', so to speak.

If service were half passable, it would be a 3.5 star. \n\nWe came in for a family dinner around 7pm, and it was a relatively decent turn out (5-6 tables seated) for a middle of the week dinner. We were seated immediately and near the back, towards the kitchen (which is fine by me). We were seated and settled in with menus (only 2 menus for a table of 4 adults and 2 kids) in hand. From that point, it took a solid 10 minutes before we felt the need to ask for our orders to be taken, at which point, we also needed to ask for water and side dishes to be brought out. \n\nSitting in plain view of the kitchen, we were able to see that our side dishes were immediately plated, placed on a tray, and left on the counter. Then they just sat there as our waitress walked back and forth...and back and forth...and back and forth. Finally after another 10 minutes, she was simply standing behind the counter looking out into the dining area. I was starting to get mildly frustrated at that point, and asked for her to bring those side dishes to us please.\n\nNow, thank goodness...the side dishes were pretty good! The marinated crab was great, the fish was nice, and everything was tasty minus the kimchi (I actually spit it out). \n\nA few minutes later our marinated kalbi and seafood pancake came - both tasted great! Kalbi was soft and well marinated, and the pancake was crispy and had a normal amount of seafood. Problem is, we asked for a pair of scissors to cut the meat for the kids. And our waitress went back to the kitchen and out again...and back...and out again...then stood at the counter, and then brought out the main course lol! \n\nI thought, \"ok, she's gonna bring it now.\" But nope! I kindly reminded her again to please bring us some scissors. \n\nThe pork dolsot bibimbap was very good, and the spicy fish stew () was also pretty solid. \n\nI'll chalk this one up to a fairly new restaurant still figuring things out with a pretty fresh staff.","date":1486526011000}

I had two of my favorite drinks: a Sazerac Royale and a French 75. Both were delicious, strong, and well balanced. Food wise, we had the cheese tray, crawfish grilled cheese, chicken sandwich, fries, salads, and dessert-- today's was a lemon tart with whipped cream and a delicious, rich raspberry sauce. \n\nCheese tray: my favorite cheese was the Humboldt fog. There was a good balance between soft and hard cheeses. Favorite part was definitely the breads though-- ours came with an olive focaccia that was well toasted, slightly salty, and perfect with the Humboldt fog and some of the preserves. \n\nCrawfish grilled cheese: not much to say besides that it won't disappoint! Crawfish, Gouda, peppers, and fresh buttered bread. Can't go wrong. \n\nChicken sandwich: I did not eat personally but was raved about by two of the others I ate with! Fried chicken with crunchy carrot celery slaw and gorgonzola dressing. Boyfriend's quote: \"pretty g-d good.\"\n\nThe fries are fried in peanut oil, which makes them much crispier than regular hand cut fries. I am typically a shoestring person but I enjoyed the crispiness of these!\n\nFinished it off with some dessert-- today's was a scrumptious lemon tart. Desserts apparently rotate, but if this one is any indicator, it's worth saving some room for. \n\nThe place was busy, busy but the staff was courteous and helpful.

The first thing that impressed me was their beer selection. They didn't offer too many beers, but what they had was pretty rare. My boyfriend and I enjoyed two Lost Coast Indica IPAs, which I thought were discontinued. At least I know the bottles were at some point. Either they just sell it in kegs now or they resurrected the beer completely. Anyway, it's an amazing IPA, and I was blown away that this place had it on tap. My second beer was a Rogue Brutal Bitter, which is fairly rare to see on tap. Both beers were delicious. We went for happy hour, so all draughts and well drinks were $1 off. Their prices are reasonable: my Indica was $4.50 with $1 off, so $3.50. Very reasonable. \n\nTheir other beers on tap included Weyerbacher Fireside Ale (granted, Weyerbacher is probably my least favorite brewery, but at least it's something different); Brooklyn Blunderbuss (a stab at an English Strong Ale... it smelled like caramel but ended up tasting all right, and not nearly as sweet as it smelled... also a pretty rare beer to see on tap); the typical Philadelphia New Bold IPA (at least it has 6.5%...); Ballast Point Wahoo Wheat (a beer I have yet to taste, but I'm not really a wheat fan); Sly Fox O'Reilly's Stout (I lived in Phoenixville for three years and enjoyed this stout all the time... comparable, if not [dare I say] better than, Guinness; and Dogfish Head Aprihop (which I've had before, but is just ehhh). They had a hand-pump as well, featuring Lagunitas Hairy Eyeball, which is a pretty damn good beer. My boyfriend and I split the Beer-Battered Green Beans, and they were really delicious.\n\nAs for atmosphere, the Prohibition Taproom really nailed it. The light is mellow and low, but not so low that you can't see where you're going. The music is at a reasonable volume, and I easily carried on a conversation the whole time. They have a jukebox, too, with a great selection! I enjoyed drinking my beer while listening to \"Born Under Punches\". And they had an old jukebox, not one of the digital ones you see all over the place now. \n\nThe place only opened in late October, but still, it was very clean. The bathroom was near immaculate... probably the cleanest bar bathroom I've seen yet in Philly. There were cool candles made out of beer bottles. I like to see a display of craftsmanship at a bar. :)\n\nThe only thing I found to be not quite up to par was their bottle selection. I desire a lot of IPAs and a lot of stouts, and they just didn't have that. Of course, I had what I liked on tap, so I didn't need to resort to bottles, but for take-out purposes, I'd like a little more variety.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, was the bartender that was serving us. She was awesome! We conversed with her pretty much the entire time we were there, and she was down to earth and knowledgeable about beer. She even covered one round of our beers because she wanted us to come back. Now that's cool in my book. I will make this my regular watering-hole for sure.","date":1235693780000}

I am always okay when a restaurant owner picks a unique design for their space. Diablo definitely has a cool, steampunk\/gothic\/saloony type of vibe for sure and I just love all the bird cages, rabbits, artwork, the layout, the fuschia velvet booths and black, old fashioned, tin ceiling and all the things that make this space unique and fun. The first time I visited, I thought it was cool. We had the fortunate experience of sitting in the large, curved, velvet booth in the back end of the restaurant. That was cool. It fit us 5 ladies perfectly and comfortably. The service was great!  Our waiter was kind, helpful, knowlegable about the food and wine and our appetizers (which is all we ordered in regards to food) and it all came out fairly quickly. My cocktail was a gin drink (Juniper something) and it was refreshing, tasty and wasn't too sweet which is how I like it. The appetizers were good. I remember the portions being somewhat small and the items being on the spendy side.  It was the same this time around, although I was not as happy with the apps that we ordered. The drinks were okay, but we have had better. Our waiter was the highlight of the experience. He didn't visit the table too may times, but just enough to make certain we were taken care of and happy. I ordered the deviled eggs. There were 3 on the plate, which my mate and I both found weird. Where did the other half of the second egg go? Did they seriously leave it off the plate? The presentation was good despite the missing egg half! ;-) The flavor of the filling was good too, but somone put WAY too much of what seemed to be an overpowering vinegar flavor in them. It was very sour and it killed the dish. That was only $5 or so, so that didn't make us too upset, but the crab cakes were another story. They are always expensive since crab meat is pricy, but you would expect for almost $13 to get better sized cakes and some with plenty of crab meat in them.  Our cakes (all 3) were very small and they had a bit of crab and an obvious filler or maybe breadcrumbs and other flavorings which were fine.  They were about the size of a silver dollar and about an inch thick (maybe!), and they were a bit greasy and they had another filler that seemed to emulate potato. (???) I wasn't a big fan. The sauce it came with was nice but fell a little bit flat. I think they could benefit from ditching the filler that they are using to stretch the ingredients, increasing the size of the crab cakes and dabbing the oil from them so that they aren't so greasy, salting them a bit, and adding some acid the dipping sauce.  I would visit again and probably try something different!","date":1580237883000}

There is very little there in your bowl, only one slice or pork a sprinkle of ground meat and noodles, not enough to be an entire meal. I tried the soy, the miso, and the spicy miso ramen. By far the spicy miso had the most flavor, but still very flat. The miso ramen was light not as miso-y as other Japanese restaurants miso soups. The soy was just a little boring for me, light broth seasoned with soy. As I dug around my bowl looking for little bites I found what I thought was a pepper cause I had the spicy ramen, turn out it was fried garlic, it was pretty dark, it was actually pretty burnt just a little to long in the oil. The bitter burnt flavor of garlic is hard to mistake and even harder to cleans from ones palette. I applaud them for frying their own garlic, but it was too burnt to be served. The gyoza were ok a little light on filling and flavor, I also wished they served it with a dipping sauce instead of just plain soy sauce or chili oil, something like a ponzu would have been good. The karage was juicy but like all the other portions seemed very small. I think I'll come back to try some udon or broth less ramen but I wasn't impressed with the food so far.","date":1442079303000}

I have gone a few times and each time had the same disappointment. We went right after they opened on a Friday night. There were a 6-8 tables with a few families, couples, groups...We opted to sit at the bar. Our bartender was great & friendly. This issue was really on the ambiance - It is just so bland. They were new - we gave it a pass.\n\nA few week later we deiced to head over on a Wednesday Night. Again we sat at the bar - no changes in ambiance. There were 4 tables. Unfortunately this time the entire staff working 1 kitchen and 4 bar\/waitstaff were hovered around the end of the bar. All were staring at there phones. I realized it was slow but it was a bit awkward. We came because it was $4.00 pints and we ordered the same beer. The chalk board advertised the $4.00 pints and listed all the beers. The beer was OK  - not great. No one really wanted to chat since they were all in their phones. We considered a second round, but we were just bored. When the check came the beers were $7.00 each. That was when we were informed that the $4.00 pints were only for the brews made there, not any visiting taps. Also, when I asked I just got a dirty look from the waitress. We paid our tab ($16.30 for 2 pints after tax and tip) and left. I get that craft brews are more than a PBR can but a $7.00 beer better be fantastic and worth paying that price.\n\nWe tried - twice - we really wanted to like it. We really wanted to have a local place- but it is just a let down. Expensive, boring, and not friendly.","date":1473255660000}

The bar was pretty busy so we weren't seated right away but the hostess\/manager (whose name I didn't catch but has a cute pixie haircut and is there pretty often) went above and beyond to make sure my friend and I were seated ASAP. She bussed and reset a table herself and had us seated within 5 or so minutes. \n       Our server, Shari, has waited on me before and she's absolutely delightful. The friend I went to dinner with is admittedly particular about his food and quite frankly a little difficult to deal with. Thankfully Shari has really great attention to detail and got every single one of my friend's silly modifications right.

We hit our solid, no brainer spots and then usually try some different places in hopes of finding another.  This was another.\n\nBradley waited on us and we decided to sit outside.  Nice guy, down to earth, very knowledgeable about the menu.  I like to try the local beers and he suggested Harbor Lager by Crooked Thumb.  I enjoy Yuengling very much and found this to be excellent.  The rest of the table kept ordering red sangria and said it was also excellent.  \n\nWe tried the scallops wrapped in prosciutto which were out of this world.  Nice and large and cooked perfectly.  We also gave the grilled octopus salad a shot.  It was large enough to serve family style.  Epic.  everything was fresh and the octopus was cooked and grilled perfectly.  I had a dozen raw oysters to myself because that's what I do.  Also a nice size and very clean.  All of the apps were above average and I'd recommend any of them. \n\nMidway through our meal a few propane fire heaters were turned on from the dropping temp.  It made a nice little added effect with the light from the fire from each heater.    \n\nThe entire table ordered the lobster pot pie for the entr\u00e9e.  Also epic.  It was not a heavy crust.  It was light and airy.  It had large chunks of lobster and the cream sauce was amazing.  I was surprised by the amount of lobster in each dish.  \n\nI think we were there for about 2 hours, which is extremely long for a dinner in my opinion.  But the service by Bradley was awesome.  The drinks were awesome.  They also had a guy come and play a solo acoustic set next to the bar.  He was also awesome.  He ripped out a crazy good cover of Led Zeppelins Babe I'm Gonna Leave You.  I didn't want to leave.  The entire experience was great.  Highly recommended.  Ask to sit in Bradleys section.","date":1523714406000}

Aside from maybe one particularly famous local steakhouse I would say the Columbia is one of the most well known dining establishments in Tampa and for good reason. My grandfather had not been to Tampa since the 1970s and when he found out I was moving to town his one recommendation was to go to Ybor and find the Columbia. Has not moved in all these years and while they have expanded their brand to other locations this location still seems to have the flavor enhancement of history and ambiance. Hands down a top 5 Cuban sandwich in town. Another not so secret probably top 1 feature is the pitcher of mojito. Stirred in the glass with a stick of pure sugar cane. So many Columbia classics really. The closest authenticity you can get outside of South America. Management clearly takes pride in their customers and their product.

Seven course meal starts with 3 salads - cucumber and tomato, eggplant, and carrots. They're all great and you eat them from a shared plate with pita bread. Don't worry - your hands have already been washed with rose water at this point.

From reading previous Yelp reviews, it looks like the owner is responsive to feedback - for example, they've got a recycling bin now. I'm hoping they keep listening to customers and improving, because with a few tweaks they could be really great. \n\nThe good:\n* The food really is FRESH. I love knowing exactly what is going into my food and being able to pick fresh fruits and veggies for my stir-fry. \n* There are a ton of options. They have suggestions for combinations, but you can put together exactly the meal that strikes your fancy. \n* The taste and quality. I really enjoyed my meals and think the bubble tea is delicious. \n* Ambiance. It's a nice place to hang out and eat. \n* Real dishes and silverware for those dining in. Eco-friendly, and it's just nice to eat off some real plates! \n\nWhat needs work:\n* Customer service. I know you've got Penn undergrads working here and they are not the easiest people to socialize into a service industry mindset. This is where you need a solid manager who is going to be on your staff to provide good service all the time. What is good service? You make eye contact, you're friendly, you use the \"customer service voice,\" you notice when customers are trying to get your attention, you take care of problems quickly. You don't, say, hide someone's bubble tea behind a register then have 2 separate employees tell me after 10 minutes that someone will be making it shortly before a third notices it hiding on a counter and points to it. \n* Inconsistency in the size of the add-ins. For a good stir-fry, the size of the ingredients should be roughly comparable so that things cook at the same speed. The broccoli, peppers, and bok choy in particular need to be cut smaller. \n* The rice. I agree with previous reviews that the rice is just dry. It tastes like Minute rice. Also, it's impossible to eat with chopsticks because it's not sticky at all. \n* Speed. I'm not expecting instant food - I know you're cooking it fresh, and your 5-10 minute estimate is reasonable. I do think there's room for improvement in the efficiency of your process - why do you have the same person filling out the form for my order, then putting the food in a bowl, then ringing it up, then adding the bizarre step of painstakingly taping my order form to its bowl? Couldn't this get streamlined somehow?\n* Cost. The base price for a bowl of white rice is $3.95, add-ons are 95 cents each (more for proteins). It would be much more reasonable if 2-3 veggies were included in the base price. \n* Personal pet peeve: the size of the opening on your trash can. If I am going to be dumping the extra food from my bowl into your trashcan before stacking my dishes, it would make my life so much easier if the opening of your trashcan were roughly comparable in size to the bowl I'm trying to scrape into it. Otherwise I am going to make a mess.","date":1334607050000}

The menu goes through all 6 of their signature items one by one, and explained everything that is in them so that you can figure out what would best fit your tastes.\n\nYou order by touch screen, similar to Wawa. I didn't quite understand the \"spiciness\"\n rating scale, and said that a bit loudly in the directing of the staff member standing right on the other side of the touch screen. He looked at me, and then continued what he was doing. So that was a bit weird. Maybe he didn't know the answer. I also asked him what I would do if I was to pay with cash (there was a slot to swipe a card and pay right at the screen, but no cash option), to which he shrugged and kept working. So..\n\nIn case you run into the same problem, the touch screen will ask you how you would like to pay, and you'll get the option to pay with cash at the cashier.\n\nSoft serve serve yourself is available, and the Lemon Honey Ginseng Tea is wonderful!\n\nMy date ordered the \"Sesame Garlic.\" There was not enough seasoning, and the steak had barely any flavor.\n\nI ordered the Sour Cherry BBQ- the noodles were undercooked (I tasted my dates, which were fine), but otherwise it was okay. \n\n\"Just okay\" isn't good enough for me to spend $10+ on the dish, so I probably won't be back, but I can't say that it wasn't tasty.","date":1417461330000}

The owners were incredible and accommodated our party of 25.  They were kind and service was great.  However ultimately, I am rating the food.  I ordered the chicken schnitzel  which is what I normally order annually for Oktoberfest.  They did not serve veal, only pork and chicken.  I felt like I was eating a chicken patty you would get from your grocers freezer.  The red cabbage was much like the red cabbage I find in jars at the grocery store and the spatzle could have been boxed mac n' cheese. My boyfriend ordered the hackbraten which tasted like a dried up meatloaf with tons of salt.  Several of our party ordered the bratwurst and knockwurst.  Everyone referred to these as hotdogs.  Not one good word came out of anyone's mouth when it came to the food.  The only positives people gave were from the service and kindness of the family.  When it came time to pay, their credit card machine was broken.  We were sent across the street to the gas station to get cash.  \n\nIn the end, I hate giving such a bad review to such kind people but there was nothing good or authentic about the cuisine.  Yes, they give two free beers with all meals which just lends to the hospitality of the owners.  We will not return.","date":1320240472000}

We were looking for a brunch spot that felt as homie as the places we are used to in north jersey. \nWe previously went to three different places, sat down and my friend just didn't like the vibe or as she put it felt like a second class citizen because of the way the host or waitress was speaking to us. I then remembered that a friend of mine had posted a picture of their meal on social media & it looked amazing.  We headed to the art museum location as it was the closest to my apartment. \nWe get there and the line was out the door I felt like  this was the right place and thought there was no way all these people were waiting as long as they were to have brunch here if this place wasn't incredible. Walked in to the front, were greeted by a big smile and the woman said the wait for a table would be 45 min to an hour but there were two seats at the counter so we decided to sit there. \n\nSabrina's staff were all fabulous but as soon as we sat down we were greeted by Delfino behind the counter who as busy as he was still gave us his undivided attention. When we got the menu and read Sabrina's (and Spencer's too) story my friend and I felt like this was the right place. Not only are the owners from jersey but they mention they had this idea of a restaurant in Philly that felt homie, friendly and unpretentious- we definitely felt that! The food is incredible, staff is extraordinary and ambience\/atmosphere felt like we were home. This will definitely be my go to place moving forward and Im so happy I found this gem!\n\nPS- my friend ordered the huevos rancheros with turkey sausage , I ate two eggs over easy with veggie sausage & we shared this delicious French toast.
