I went to the register and cut the line to ask about my order.  They stated \"yeah we are out of it all\".  That's fine, it happens, I get that.   So asked what do you have? She was nice and told me a couple of things so i ordered one of them.   The lady cooking the food was pissed and was calling out about she doesn't control what she has.   Yeah I know I'm not mad about that.  When I got my sandwich it was smashed, falling apart, and thrown into the bag.   It was a mess!

People who did not have dim sum - I discounted them immediately as there can be a wide gap between the dim sum experience and the lunch\/dinner dining experience.\n\n2. People who do not understand dim sum - I discounted their perspective on everything but the food because they had actually tasted what I wanted to taste.\n\n3. People who are dim sum aficionados - I treated their opinions like gold as long as they were established Yelpers.\n\nSo...on to the review...\n\nWe decided on dim sum but the women in my family dragged their collective asses so long that a 12:30 arrival looked sadly optimistic by the time we left the house.  My very strong preference is to arrive quite a bit earlier so that everything is fresh and hasn't been riding around on the carts for an hour or more.  You will understand this concern if you enjoy Hong Kong style dim sum.  It is all hand-made and in most places they do run out of things.  The teen drove and we had a bit of trouble finding the place which led to an even longer delay in arrival.  Still, we walked right in and were seated immediately.  I attribute this to the fact that we were the only people in the dining room initially.  I asked the woman who seated us if we would be able to get fresh dim sum and she assured me that we would.  This was the beginning of the surreality.\n\nThere was a considerable number of staff clearing and re-setting tables so I am guessing that we had arrived shortly after their Saturday rush had departed.  Regardless, a woman appeared with a cart even before our beverages arrived.  The wife quickly grabbed a couple of items off the cart and I picked one that looked especially good - shrimp & scallop steamed dumpling.  The interesting thing about my first bite was that the noodle had a really good taste and consistency.  The filling was good and tasted very fresh but I kept flashing back to the noodle - it was simply better tasting and had a more appealing consistency than most of the places we go.\n\nA few minutes later the same woman appeared with a different cart full of stuff.  I picked out the bbq pork buns that I like and tried a bite.  Rather than the red pork that you typically find these buns had a shredded pork barbeque inside of them.  The pork was good but what was amazing was how fresh and flavorful the rice flour bun dough tasted.  Once again, the starch stole the show.\n\nAbout this point in the meal, a waitress turned up with their picture menu.  I picked out a couple of things and was told that it would be a few minutes because they had to make those items in the kitchen.  Also, a woman showed up and pitched several items to the wife that weren't on the menu.  She bit on the notion of shrimp & tofu and then the woman said \"ok, I'll go make it for you.\"  Absolutely surreal!\n\nOther dishes came and went.  Some we loved, others weren't a great hit.  When we were finally finished the kid decided on a dessert.  She liked it quite a bit so the lady who pushes the cart around simply brought her one in a go container.  She also took home an entire order of pot stickers which she ate with dinner and declared delicious.\n\nAs we walked out I noticed that there were several Chinese families in the restaurant having dim sum - none of which I saw on the carts or on the picture menu.  Surreal...","date":1403494397000}

I hesitated writing a review in the past because I didn't have what Trio is known for, pizza, prior to my last visit. \n\nMy very first visit was a spur of the moment decision with my coworkers. Since I had pizza the night before I was a little apprehensive about going. When we arrived at the establishment there was a board listing a bunch of specials. Since I was not interested in having pizza anyway, I went with the spaghetti and clams. Now when I order clams outside of a seafood or good steak establishment it's more than a toe in the water moment for me. Off course it was not the best Spaghetti and clams I shoved my face with, but I will order the same dish from here again without hesitation. \n\nOn my second visit, I wasn't really sure what I wanted. On my first trip, my friend and fellow Yelper had a cheesesteak with banana peppers. That is what I had on my mind as I parked the car but, the specials board caught my eye again. The minute I saw the Sausage Panini listed the cheesesteak was no longer an option. Now the Paninis are not what you expect. They are pretty much just sandwiches and not placed in a Panini press...blah...blah...blah...who gives a rats a$$, that was one good sandwich.  It took me some time before I was able to dig in because it was served to me seconds after it was finishing cooking. The sauce had a nice and easy kick to it. \n\nNow we finally get the heart & soul of Trios, their pizza. If we are going off first impressions I have to say it was not impressive at all. When I received my pizza it was cold. I guess the young lady heated it up and allowed it to sit while she was waiting for the kitchen to complete my friends order. Now, I did say to bring our food out at the same time, just thought the pizza would have went in a little later. I can't get the full effects of a slice if it is not warm, excuse me hot. You could have looked at the slice and realized it was not warm just by looking at the sauce. \n\nI am still a fan based upon the other items I have tried at Trio's. I will need to give the pizza another shot, but I realize everyone has their own interpretation of hot so I will have to be very direct","date":1366738577000}

Alas, they have been around forever and seem to comfortable with who they are. There is something to be said for that.\n\nOther reviews seem to be right on about the bread (Amoroso rolls) the goodies are tucked into:\n\nChloe O.: \"The bread was excellent.\"\nPaul C.: \"EXTREMELY delicious chewy roll\"\nLauren T.: \"I really like their roll they use.\"\n\n\nLauren and Paul also agree about the unusual layout and the only napkin holder being banished to the end of the counter like it had misbehaved. About those napkins: they seem to be the cheapest, thinnest kind you can buy. Being that the sandwiches can be kind of messy, this doesn't seem like the kind of thing you want to cut corners on... just sayin'.\n\nBut this ain't about the napkins;it's about the food... which is just OK. The bread steals the show... which tends to overshadow the other ingredients, namely the meat. Seems to me they could strike a better balance between all the ingredients. Still, there are worse sandwiches in this town. Is that a backhanded compliment or glowing endorsement? You decide.\n\nIf you get fries with your sandwich, they'll be nice, fresh, crinkly cut planks of happiness. Beware though; they'll ask, \"would you like ranch for your fries?\"... and then proceed to charge you $.40. I'm not exactly cheap but, hey, I can go to Eegees and get free ranch with my fries.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\nGood Bread\nSkimpy sandwich fillings\nCrinkly cut fries dipped in $.40 ranch dressing\nNapkin fail\n\nI'll be back... but I'll probably bring my own napkins and just use the free ketchup.","date":1474735321000}

However, the waffles were very good and it's hard to find a breakfast restaurant that makes crunchy and fluffy waffles versus the cake-like waffles that aren't worth eating.  The only downside to the great waffles is that Datz serves them with imitation syrup.  Concerning the atmosphere and service, I liked the casual feel inside, but many people were seated outside in the covered area.  Finally, the service was good, which was appreciated as our server gave us some food recommendations.  Overall, the wife and I will return to Datz as I think they're really more than a 3 star place, and I'm anxious to try the chicken and waffles.","date":1615060085000}

I was visiting some friends in Indy when they took us to meet others at the new video bar.  It reminds me of a small scale Mini Bar if compared to Chicago's Boystown (without the half naked bartenders). Tini's has a pleasant, quaint feel with plenty of TVs to watch music videos play while conversing. The bar is nicely lit with LED lights and staff were not only friendly but easy on the eyes. The cocktails were tasty (I had the Cosmo which threw me off since it was transparent versus pink), however, our entire party's drinks were filled far from the rim. Bit of a disappointment for roughly $10 a drink. Otherwise, nice ambience and crowd. Hope you like Lady Gaga since she seemed to be 90% of the videos.","date":1325475601000}

My husband and I have been here twice and both times placed the same order. He gets the red curry which is why we came back. It is his favorite curry in Boise and we've tried most all the Thai restaurants in town. Both times I've ordered the Pad Thai and been disappointed. I order it with chicken and medium spice. First time the noodles were nearly bare and there was minimal taste and absolutely no spice. This time the noodles were well coated, but quite oily and the spice was inconsistent through the dish, from no spice to stealing some of my husband curry to clear the spice from my pallet. Stirring the dish up helped, but it remained oily and the only taste was the spice, not the dimensional flavors of a good pad Thai.

Arrived at 4:20pm in a Friday and didn't get our food to take home until around 5:30pm.  There were 3 orders in front of us and a steady flow after us.  Two people working, Hank and a lady.  After they gave the customers waiting their orders they then took ours and the couple behind us.  While waiting and watching it seems they take 2-3 orders at a time and after filling those they take more orders.  However, they don't explain this or greet those waiting to place an order.  After picking up your order you pay.  Definitely not the friendliest either.  They expect you to know your order when at the window.  I was surprised that they actually seemed perturbed with our larger order.  You would think a large order with sides, desserts and several pounds of meat would be appreciated.\n\nInterior is small waiting area with about 5-6 chairs to sit while waiting on your order.  There's a TV with the menu scrolling and that's about it.  Do have to say the aroma of the BBQ was wonderful while waiting!  \n\nBrisket & ribs, cole slaw and baked beans were alright.  We like our ribs to fall off the bone and these weren't as tender as we usually like.  Brisket was very fatty and needed a little more seasoning.  Side of potato salad was probably the worst we've had in a long time.  Potato salad was almost a greenish yellow color and had a curry or funny spice taste to it.  People only tried a bite and tossed the rest.  Baked beans were tasty especially if put some chopped brisket mixed in them.  Caramel apple and peach cobblers were okay.

It's essentially got everything anyone expects at a market - ice cream shop, cheese vendor, deli stands, and even one that's owned by an Amish group (correct me if I'm wrong...sorry!). So many different selections there, and it's always such a hard decision coming here with a limited budget. \n\nEven better, Chinatown is essentially right next doors. Go for a nice bubble tea or authentic Szechuan cuisine just one block down! Plus, Dim Sum Garden always has amazing food! The Gallery is right by the market, too; so if you're not in the mood for Chinese Food, maybe you're in the mood to do some shopping. \n\nI'm not rating it 5 stars for two reasons: Reading Terminal Market is great, but unfortunately, being in the center of the city, it is a bit small. I hope one day, the Market will go through an underground renovation and add a basement! Also, I wish there were an easy exit\/entrance by 11th street. I've discovered a sketchy exit onto Arch\/11th, but it's used for trucks to load and unload.

We ordered the spring rolls which is actually a summer roll (fresh egg roll with rice wrapper shrimp, pork, vermicelli noodle and peanut sauce) and the chicken wings. The spring\/summer roll was pretty good, nice size portion but the chicken wings were bomb! The honey\/fish sauce combo is brilliant! It comes with only six wings but I probably could have eaten a double portion with some white rice and would have been extremely satisfied. We also ordered the grilled beef over vermicelli noodles with some fresh lettuce, cucumbers and pickled veggies in a bowl topped with peanuts and that was pretty good as well.\n\nOverall, our experience was very good.  The menu isn't extensive but for an economical lunch or dinner, you definitely can't go wrong and since there isn't much competition around, the pricing is definitely surprising.

Super slow experience unless you tell them you are on a schedule. I did not think the amount of food you get is at all appropriate for $35\/person. I've been to many other restaurants for Devour and received much more food for this amount or less. I had the fennel salad (the dressing was best part) and my husband had the wings (great flavor but five very small wings). We both had the flatiron steak entree. Amazing taste and flavors but the portion size was way too small. The featured dessert was tres leches cake and it was the saddest cream based cake I've ever had (especially considering we were dining at a creamery). It was a dry and flavorless piece of sheet cake. Devour week is supposed to be a way to hook you and bring you back outside of this week of specials. The Loft at Trader's Point did not deliver for us. Many other great places to try so skip this place and make your reservation someplace else.","date":1517616333000}

All of it best paired with some cole slaw and old bay fries to really make you feel like you've satisfactorily gained five pounds in one sitting.\n\nDescriptions aside, the only issue I have is one of the normal aspects of being human - Forgetfulness. You order something a particular way, and it never seems to come out correct, unless it's a simple plate of wings. On rare occasions, you even get the wrong item entirely. But the food remains good enough that everyone continues to come back, despite the slip-ups.","date":1582906755000}

But, when we went there, we realized it isn't any different than any other restaurant that has an outside patio. \n\nBy this mentality, Cori's DogHouse down the street, is dog friendly and they don't advertise it, as much as this place does.\n\nWhen I think dog friendly, I think of restaurants that can have dogs in the restaurants such as Fetch Bar & Grill that is in Kansas. My expectations were probably too high, as I expected more, not just empty water bowls sitting outside. \n\nNow our waitresses was attentive and made sure we were taken care of. Yet, the food....is food. One surprising thing though - is there was no drink specials or specialty drinks that were based off dogs They are missing a potential advertising opportunity with this lapse.

Their veggie burger is easily the best veggie burger I've ever had in my life. It's my go-to every time I go- the Harvest burger with nothing added to it. It comes with lettuce, tomato, and onion, and in my opinion that's all it needs (besides the sauces). The patty itself is a mix of beans, brown rice, and veggies, and I feel like it kinda looks like a small brick. It's not round shaped or made to look like a real hamburger. It is its own special self and is so absolutely unashamed about it. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.\n\nAnd oh man the sauces. The burgers come with a sort of barbecue\/ketchup sauce and an aioli sauce that are both so, so good. I dream about Cowbell sauces. I end up usually subbing out the fries for a side of the vegetable of the day (which has never not been a zucchini blend) or the kale salad. It's not that their french fries are bad, I just prefer sweet potato fries, which they don't have. \n\nThey also have amazing mac and cheese- I like the lobster one better than the crawfish one, because I feel like it was a little less salty. Both are really good, but just be prepared for how rich the mac and cheese is. I took about 4 bites and felt like I really didn't need to eat anymore (which is coming from a person who consumes everything in front of her).\n\nTheir desserts are also bomb. I love their seasonal pumpkin dessert, but their blondie is also worth trying too. Cowbell is a staple in my diet, and any time my family comes into town they beg me to take them there. If you've never had a veggie burger before in your life, try one here first. You can thank me later.","date":1503520253000}

In all those years, with the exception of busy times and new employees, the worst behavior I have witnessed is possibly someone coming across as brusque and uncaring when all they were trying to do is serve a busy place. When Monk's is slow as it was for this review, they have always been personable and very helpful when I was trying to find a beer that I might like from the new arrivals. I would be stunned to see \"the brunette curly haired bartender\" exhibit any attitude or rudeness to any customer, regular or infrequent. To say she is beloved by the Philadelphia clientele would be an understatement. Philadelphians come to Monk's frequently just to enjoy her company and some fine beer and food. There was a time when Monk's was the only place in Philadelphia you could get a decent beer but that is no longer the case. The enduring charm of the staff and the food keeps people coming back to Monk's when they now have many other choices. I don't know if there was any jealousy involved when the bartender was sitting with someone (who I can only assume was a regular) and not paying the attention James D. felt he deserved, but \"rude and nasty\" NO WAY. There is no way Jodi would neglect a customer like that. I hope that James D. will give her and Monk's another chance, if not it will be his loss.","date":1469800820000}

There were 14 of us so we had to pick the menu ahead of time. We chose the Big Night Out option which gave us a taste of pretty much all The Melting Pot has to offer-3 cheeses, 2 broth\/oil options and three chocolate fondues for the group to share. The cheese - we had traditional, three cheese, and Fiesta. These were definitely a table favorite. We had the two standard broth\/oil selections. That was actually the most fun because you're cooking your food, battering and deep frying all kinds of fun stuff and using the 'search and rescue' spoon to find the items you lost. \n\nThe food gets a 4 star, but the set up gets 3. Depending on where you were sitting at the table, you did not have access to each of the pots for dipping and it was really hard to switch the pots around so that we could rotate. I wish there was a better way for everyone to be able to try each offering.  With three choices, there was no way to easily try all three options. This wasn't as big an issue with the broth & oil course because there were only two options so the pots were more spread out, but I definitely felt like I missed out on the cheese & dessert.\n\nPlus with a group of 14, we were seated at one long table with the one side being a bench seat. If someone in the middle needed to get up, the entire row needed to stand up and file out for the one person to leave the table. Kind of annoying over the course of a 3 hour meal. \n\nOverall, a fun, reasoably priced night out for our office. We are a rowdy crowd and it's definitely something we would do again.

(I have no regrets) This is definitely not a place that skimps on portions, starting with the gigantic clay oven baked bread. \n\nThe bread was freshly baked and delicious, and was included in my order of Fahsah (stewed shredded lamb). Extra bread can also be ordered separately for $2. The stewed lamb was very tender and served bubbling hot in a clay pot that kept it warm through my entire meal. Combined with the soft, warm bread, it was an amazing combination. \n\nThe Lamb Haneeth consists of slow-roated lamb, rice, and mixed veggies. The lamb was melt-in-your-mouth tender and fell right off the bone. The veggies were beautifully seasoned and went very well with the rice and lamb. It was definitely one of the better-prepared lamb dishes I've had in a while. \n\nService is friendly and pricing is fair. The food is delicious and flavorful. It's a great neighborhood joint and I definitely plan on coming back!","date":1537670148000}

I hope in time they will be able to deliver.\n\nThe menu is essentially set up as a three course tasting menu, with dessert as an optional. Changing daily, based on what they are able to source, it is clearly a surprise what is on the menu.\n\nAs it was a blustery fall night, I opted for two dishes that felt like they were fall to me.. a delicous butternut squash soup, that also had sunflower seeds and a bit of speck in the bottom. Great,,, a taste of the season. I followed that with acorn squash ravioli, served with hazlenuts, and gala apples in a brown butter sage sauce. Good but not as flavorful as I was expecting. This course they also messed up my DC's order, forgeting to put his lobster in. That threw off the whole pace of the dinner.\n\nThe third course we both opted for lamb shoulder, served on a bed of spinach, and turnips. Felt like the dish was a bit salty, and not sure if this was a result of over salting, or whether the sauce reduced while cooking extra long while the lobster dish was fired.\n\nWe passed on dessert as the choices were uninspiring (creme brulle and an apple struedel,,, ). We also had a hiccup with the final bill as they under charged us, and wanting to be honest, we brought that to their attention, which then resulted in an additional ten minutes to leave the restaurant.\n\nI love the place, the staff, and the concept.

The restaurant is decorated nicely, but it is very loud. The place was packed but the six of us were seated within 10 minutes. We started by sharing an order of pork nacho's which was very good, and an order of hushpuppies, which were crispy on the outside and soft and flavorful on the inside, with a yummy aioli sauce that I enjoyed. I had the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato casserole and corn casserole for my sides. The pork was wonderful, tender and smoky, and I liked their BBQ sauce options. The sweet potato casserole was delicious with a streusel topping of brown sugar and pecans that was very yummy, not too sweet. The corn casserole was fair, a little on the dry side. My husband had the chicken and dumplings, which was good, but a tad salty, and the french fries and creamed spinach, which were both very good. We had more than plenty of food on our plates, I took half my sandwich home in a to-go box. My ice tea was served in a mascon jar, which I kind of like. The alcohol drinks are a tad on the high side, but beer is pretty fairly priced.  Our waiter was wonderful and worked his butt off refilling drinks and bringing food to us, he did a great job.

It's also the kind of place where you don't expect to see your glass empty.  Ever.  At the end of your meal, you'll get a steaming tray of mints and truffles, just for eating there.  The salad forks come to you chilled.  There's a sorbet between the appetizer and the entree, topped with a little champagne by your table captain.  There are dudes called \"table captains\" here.  That's the kind of place Harrah's Steak House is.  If you aren't wearing dress pants and a nice shirt here, you should go someplace else.  You don't deserve the kind of experience you're about to get.\n\nThe service at Harrah's is amazing.  The ma\u00eetre d' will offer to take your coats and show you to your seats, asking if you'd prefer a booth or a table.  Upon sitting, a bottle of champagne will immediately be placed in the high-hat beside every table.  You'll be offered some, as well as a look at their extensive wine list.  You'll be asked for appetizers and drinks.  Order them.  At no point in your time there will your glass ever dip below half full.  Things will just appear on your table without you noticing, like salad forks and the like.  The staff is extremely attentive.  It's the kind of place where, if you look up at any time, someone will come over.  They take extremely good care of you here.  Ask the waiters and table captains for advice.  Some of them have been there for literally decades, and they know what they're talking about.\n\nTableside preparation is an art here, and the servers and captains take it very seriously.  I was lucky enough to order both the Caesar salad and the bananas foster at my last trip here, and they were both jaw-dropping.  The dressing for the Caesar salad is made by hand, with anchovies, garlic cloves, Dijon mustard, olive oil, red wine vinegar, Parmesan cheese, and other ingredients mixed for you in your salad bowl.  It was the best Caesar I've ever had.  The bananas foster is even more theatric, with the lights over your booth dimmed and the flame spiked about three feet high during the preparation.  It might very well be the tastiest thing that's been in my mouth in 25 years (that's what she said).  \n\nAs far as the steak goes, it was heavenly.  I ordered a 13oz. Filet Mignon done oscar style (crab, asparagus, and Bearnaise sauce on top), and it was the best steak I've ever eaten.  Nothing even comes close.  It was buttery soft.  I don't particularly like the phrase \"melts in your mouth,\" but it really is apt here.  The sides are amazing, as well.  My dish came with a colorful and artfully arranged assortment of carrots, beets, garlic mashed potatoes (which were a deep green color), and red-skinned potatoes.  I ordered my steak medium rare and received a perfect medium rare.  My girlfriend ordered Parmesan crusted chicken, and it was arguably better than my steak.  Aside from the preparation itself, the actual chicken meat tasted extremely good.  I don't know if there's such a thing as high quality, premium chicken, but this place makes me suspect that there is. \n\nDinner at Harrah's Steak House is the best dining experience I've ever had.\n\nOne of the best kept secrets in Reno is LUNCH at the Harrah's Steak House.  The lunch menu features steak and other goodies for extremely attractive prices.  Like, $15 for a Filet Mignon burger.  It's amazing food and amazing service, for around the same price as a meal at Applebee's.","date":1268869842000}

Outside of that, it's easy to find a space and service has been reasonably quick when I've visited.  They do have a small bar you can sit at if you don't need a table.\n\nInside, it's like many Thai restaurants.  If you're a fan of Thai food, I'm sure you've seen places like this; little trinkets or decorations everywhere, seems to be family run, little grit and grime around the edges but not enough that it bothers you if the food is great, excellent service and gracious servers.  They're also open reasonably late for a beach restaurant.  They do not have liquor, but do have beer and wine.\n\nFood-wise, excellent.  I've had the ginger salad which was crisp and fresh, not overloaded with dressing.  I've had the unagi (eel) sushi rolls; these I'm not as much of a fan of as I'm used to unagi being served on top of rice, not inside the roll.  There was nothing wrong with the taste, I just like the unagi to rice ratio to be much more eel.  The Tom Yum Gai soup (chicken soup with chili paste, lemon juice, mushroom, lemongrass, scallion and cilantro) is excellent.  Finally, my fav, Chicken Panang Curry; that's pretty much how I judge one Thai place to the next and theirs is excellent.  It comes out with the rice on the side so you can mix in what you want.

My fiance and I went over there and I ordered the mild, while he ordered the hot.  The chicken was dry - and when I say dry, I mean it was too tough to even chew - I didn't finish my meal - neither did my fiance.  The spice was just heat with no flavor.

Once at the table our waiter took our drinks order, and explained the menu, this is where we found out that we could get a 7oz steak with a side of pasta. \nSkip the side salad and choose the soup. I got the salad and it was served on a small plate with iceberg lettuce and covered in ranch.  The soup that others in the party ordered, was SO GOOD, a chicken and Rice. I missed out.\nI ordered the Steak w a side of basic red sauce pasta. The Pasta and sauce were so freaking good, I wish I would have ordered more to bring home. The steak was cooked perfectly and cut like butter. When combining a piece of steak with some of the pasta and sauce, that was where food magic happened. I am so happy I went with the steak and pasta combo.

It didn't matter; I really enjoyed my lunch and can recommend the Cunetto House of Pasta to others. We'd eaten well and had no room left for dessert. Given time, I would explore every restaurant on or near the Hill, but this was a great place to start. Mangia!","date":1408905149000}

I ordered the pancakes. Luckily I added chocolate chips and extra syrup. I don't know what the batter was made from, but it tasted like a corn muffin to me. We also ordered a cupcake and a whoopie  pie to take back to the hotel. I thought they were both very dry, had a grainy texture, and not sweet.

The main reason I wanted to try them out is because of their butterfly pea flower drink. I had read about this flower a couple years ago and how it is used for tea in a drink called nam dok anchan. I was wondering when I'd see it in Tampa. Well, the wait is finally over. It's an interesting drink because of its bright natural blue color and when adding lime (or orange), it changes its color to purple. Aside from the cool colors, it has a lot of health benefits which I won't go into. Their butterfly pea limeade has a sweet and salty flavor, sort of like a salted lemonade that you commonly find at Viet restaurants. I enjoyed it and recommend asking for it as its not on the menu (as of yet).\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the chicken panang. They have a more traditional take on this dish. Not really any veggies included like you'll see at other restaurants, except for some garnishes.  The sauce is a little different than most places. I immediately could tell they use lime in the curry and it isn't as sweet as most panang curries I've tried, though I wish it was. It was still good though. I also requested it mild and it had enough of a kick for me.\n\nService was great (minus the billing error which was resolved). Very accommodating and friendly. The restaurant is large and airy with high wood beam ceilings. The prices are a tad higher than most Thai restaurants but the portion size is decent and it did come with a side salad. I would definitely return as I'm interested in trying other things on the menu and of the nearly 30 Thai restaurants I've been to around Tampa, this restaurant is definitely in the top half.","date":1474324468000}

If multiple people are ordering at the table from their phones, only the first one to order will be locked in while the remaining phones will be notified AFTER payment info is entered, \"there is already an order at the table.\" Wait the few moments and it starts over again. So food will come out aggressively staggered. I suggest using one phone to order. Splitting the check at the end is a nightmare on our phones so I again recommend using one card and figuring it out later. Last time I came into BarTaco the previous tables order was still active under the QR code and somebody came by to take my order verbally. The order was incomplete and incorrect. Somebody (who I assume is the manager) came by to apologize. But again, because the previous tables order was still on the QR code, it took a manager to get me my receipt and payment correct.

The oysters were well fried and tasted fresh, even after I got back to the hotel.  The bread was nice and chewy the way a French roll should be.  The lettuce and tomato were fine.\n\nMy 3 stars were because of two other items. First of all, the service was slow.  Granted there was only 1 bartender, but I don't think he said a word to me the whole time I was there.  Secondly, I asked for no mayo, but requested a side remolaude.  They charged me $1 for it.  I don't mind paying extra for my sides, but $1 when I was getting it in place of the mayo that comes on the sandwich seems steep.\n\nMy suggestion is after spending some time on Bourbon St and you are getting the hungries on the way back to your hotel, skip the lucky dogs and stop by Le Bayou.

Highly recommend , don't be afraid because it's a small hole in the wall!","date":1456690937000}

Huge portion with lots of black beans for the base (which made it even better!).  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the salsa verde on top had some nice kick to it.  Poured some of their hot sauce on the top and devoured the whole thing.\nThey are known for baked goods and were on every table. As I was paying my bill and looking at all the baked goodies behind the counter I had a weak moment. Asked the cashier what was best and said she invented something I didn't get the name of but wow. It was a combination between a danish and sweet bun (?) and had raspberry flavor, gining it a pink\/red color.  The taste and texture was incredible.

It was my least favorite brunch place I went to on my recent trip to New Orleans.   I can see why a lot of people could like it, but I am a health nut and this place wasn't for me.   \n\nService was excellent and we were seated immediately around 8am on a weekday, though it seemed like it was almost full and bustling.   I ordered an ice coffee with almond milk to start.  (It's great they serve French Truck Coffee and have almond milk!). It arrived in a reusable plastic cup, and they also served water in a reusable plastic cup.  For me this is a huge pet peeve.  Maybe I am paranoid but it's a scientific fact that washing and reusing plastic items in warm or hot water will cause harmful toxins such as BPA to leach into food and drink.  Google it if you never heard of it.  I prefer not to patronize restaurants that use reusable plastic cups or plates for this reason.  I asked the waitress if they serve their food on plastic plates and she confirmed they did, and that they were reusable.  I didn't drink my iced coffee or order any food for this reason.   \n\nWhen restaurants use cheap reusable plastic plates  it makes me wonder, what else are they cutting corners\/costs on?\n\nI did try part of my husband's biscuit.  It was layered on top of some spinach so hopefully it didn't touch the toxic plate.  It was extremely heavy, dense, borderline hard and tasted like it was soaked in butter.  Probably good for a hangover.  I could see how people could like it but I prefer a softer, lighter and airier type of biscuit - such as the one I tried at Willa Jean - which was perfection and far superior in my oto the Ruby Slipper one.  That's just my opinion and others may think differently though.\n\nAgain service was excellent and the menu looked great but with so many other stellar dining options in the area with non-toxic cups and plates I personally would never return.\n\nUpdate: Added a star because of the conscientious reply from the restaurant.  However, BPA is not the only chemical found in plastic or melamine and I still wouldn't feel safe using plastic ware.  BPA-free doesn't mean chemical free.  For example, BPS has been found to be an even greater endocrine disrupter than BPA.","date":1561405326000}

She asked if she could get \"pure chicken\" off of the rotisserie spit and it was \"now you gotta wait for it to cook\". She tossed the container like she was going to score two points in the trash.  After a full 2 minutes of a thin chicken rotating around dim heat, the girl without the nose pierce got the rest of the order taken care with no problems...... Skip and go to smash burger instead. Glad the cashier gave me 1 $5 instead of 5 $1's....  decent food, just poor customer service. (Over some sauce the server thinks is irrelevant......)","date":1446310160000}

The grind they use on the beef plus not over cooking made an incredibly juicy and flavorful patty, and combining that with great havarti cheese and thick bun which can soak up those juices was exceptional.  My girlfriend split it with me as I think it was going to be perfect at this point (didnt want to take half home).  And it was filling as a half a burger.\n\nSteak slider were under cooked, I asked for medium to medium rare, I got medium rare to rare.  Not a big deal, and certainly could have sent them back to get fixed, but that burger was so damn good, I took the sliders home and we threw them in the broiler for a couple minutes and they made a great, lite evening meal.  All good.  Just might want to make sure if you order them that you ensure you get the steaks the way you want.  Ruths Chris is always great about addressing those types of issues (they are a steakhouse after all).\n\nFinally, I am a carrot\/spice cake fiend and I had to order the carrot cake cupcake to go.

Terrible red sauce. Milky white salsa?\n\nEager to find a place that serves \"authentic\" Mexican cuisine in West Philly I took a chance Guacamole Mex. Big mistake.\n\nThe Chips and Salsa\n\nI was given the option of mild or hot salsa. The hot \"salsa\" came out as a small cup of a milky red sauce. What is this? Mayo with sriracha? Definitely not salsa. It tasted of ground up Hot Andy Cap snack fries and mayo. Gross. Don't call it salsa if it is not salsa. The unheated store bought variety chips didn't help the situation. Bad sign when an \"authentic\" Mexican restaurant can't even make their own warm tortilla chips. \n\nThe Meal \n\nI chose two of my favorites: cheese enchiladas and marinated pork tacos. Given the quality of the chips and salsa I was indeed worried about the main course. \n\nThe enchiladas, which weren't even hot, were covered with what looked to be a slice of American cheese and an overly sweet red sauce. This sauce tasted more like canned Hunt's tomato sauce than any enchilada sauce I've ever experienced. What a mess. The bubbling, hot, cheesiness I expect in cheese enchiladas was nowhere to be found in this disaster. \n\nThe marinated pork taco was the only redeeming part of my meal. Though again not hot enough in temperature, the seasoned pork (which I believe was just Chorizo), pineapple, cilantro and onion filling was a great complementary mix of flavors but the weird cheese slice could have been replaced by a shredded variety. A corn shell would have worked better than its flour shell. \n\nOverall a disappointment that cost me 18.75. Guacamole Mex-Grill is not a restaurant I'll ever be returning to. I normally give 1-star ratings to restaurants I would never return to, however the pork taco bumped it up a star.","date":1383441013000}

Right?  However, I am relatively sure he is steering this ship, known as the Rudder, right in to the same iceberg that sent the Titanic to it's cold, watery grave.\n\nI am in Nashville every June for CMA Fest and visit some very good friends that live in Hendersonville, TN.  This is one of my most favorite nights when I come and visit.  A good friend from my hometown lives in Hendersonville, he and his wife have a nice boat we take out every time I am in town, and this past week was no different.  And, it was perfect weather..  My Gf and I, my friend and his wife, two other couples and another friend all loaded on to two boats and made our way toward The Rudder.\n\nI had heard nightmares about wait times from my friend, but we were not worried as it was a Tuesday night, how bad could it be?  Well, if Stephen King is looking for a new nightmare to consider for his next book, consider The Rudder.(And that ain't a bad name is it Stephen for a book?)\n\nWe arrived and we were told 45 minute wait, even though clearly there were clean and open tables all over the place.  But, okay, we have good company, the boats are docked and we have beer, could be worse..  Back on to the boats, we drink, chat and play some tunes..  45 minutes go by, 50 minutes, 55 minutes, 1 hour..  I was starting to consider if I should start reviewing my will, and when my social security should start kicking in..  I am pretty certain my hair was falling off my head in some grayish color..  Well, finally we get buzzed (different kind of buzzed) to head up to the restaurant, and we are all starving by now.  We are seated and wait about another 10 minutes before our server arrived.  She did seem very nice, but VERY overwhelmed.  She took our drink orders, well, about 15  minutes later the drinks arrive..  Which was OK because I was able to call friends I may never see again as I began to decay at this place..  We put our app orders in..  I ordered the boneless barbecue wings, calamari was also ordered with some fried pickles as well.  About 40 minutes later the apps come out.  In this time, not once were we asked if we needed anything else to drink.  Should be mentioned my friend has a young Daughter in tow, starting to get a tad late now..  Anyway, apps come out, and I will say my wings were pretty good.  Just the right amount of barbecue sauce, which flat out tells me the chef at least trusts his ability to make boneless wings.  The Calamari?  Ugh..  They were drowning in so much oil that I thought they may actually try to swim away, and they were SO chewy, it was like popping a bag of Big League Chew in your mouth, pretty gross.  Everyone put their food orders in..  Well, entrees came out staggered, there were 10 of us and 5 entrees made their way out, this being about 45 minutes later.  Even more confusing is, my GF ordered just chicken tenders with Mac n Cheese, same as our friend Katie, Katie's came out and my GF'S didn't, huh?  I know I am no Michellin 5 star chef, but in my little mind, I seem to think sending out two orders of chicken tenders shouldn't be as challenging as trying to launch a NASA satellite in to orbit.  Well, I got the Sirloin Sandwhich and it was DISGUSTING, Bland, Cold, little seasoning and I about chipped four teeth after I bit in to the roll that seemed like it has been around since the days the Dinosaurs ruled the world (I think even a Velosoraptor would by pass this hole)  The rest of the food came out about 15 minutes later, everyone at the table said their food was either cold or just gross.

The eel was well presented.\n\nThe scorch is their gimmick sushi. I like it because they torch the top of the sushi. Some how I don't like the sauce on top. I don't like their spicy mayo.

Small, compact. Maybe enough to sit and serve 18-20 people. Secondly, it is a sushi\/cafe combo which is different. Don't see those two together too often. Not a bad thing, just different. I showed up on a Tuesday afternoon 3 days after a major blizzard, so I was the only one in the restaurant. So, needless to say I was seated immediately by my cheery waitress and given a glass of water and menu. The tables here are small, but no smaller than any caf\u00e9 I've been too. Easy enough to maneuver and eat. But then again, I was alone here. \n\nAs for the food, I started off with steamed pork gyoza. Pretty much a staple of sushi restaurants. They came out very quickly. Nice sized, 5 per order, and a good amount of pork inside. A good starter but nothing to rave about. Just a simple appetizer done right. \n\nAnd for sushi, I ordered the emerald city, wildfire, and hamachi (yellowtail\/cucumber) \nThe hamachi was ok. Seemed like it was mostly yellowtail. Didn't really see much cucumber in it. \n\nThe emerald city was very good. It was a cooked roll. So it was served warm and with a drizzle of eel sauce. Definitely a good choice.\n\nThe wildfire was also very good. It was drizzled in the same sauce as the emerald city. So, I didn't mind the extra helping to dip my sushi in.\n\nOverall, if you don't mind tight spaces this is a great choice for a quick sushi fix. For the one appetizer and three rolls (one maki, two specialty) was about $40. So, It's not the cheapest. But its really good sushi, with a friendly staff in and worth you time if you're in Fairmount\/Brewerytown area.","date":1453837563000}

You can not dine in or pick up. You have to place an order from them through food delivery services such as Door Dash, Post Mates, or Grub Hub I Placed an order through Door Dash and ended up paying $10+ in fees (tip and delivery fee) on top of the cost of my meal. Ordering from one of those sites is very simple and straightforward. I would try to get one of the promos if I can though.  They do run a lot of first time user promos. \n\nMy meal was delivered in a reasonable time considering the distance, but was a bit cold.  I had to heat up my fries.  I got the Beast Burger Combo and a grilled cheese.  The food was delicious. The fries, after i reheated them, were very tasty. The seasoning they use has a little kick. I wish they would allow customer pickup though to save the delivery fees and get your food a bit warmer. I would have given it 3 stars but i accepted that the food would have to travel a ways and would probably be cold. And I hit purchase after the delivery fee and tip, which you can vary the percent you give. As I mentioned the food is definitely delicious. It has tons of flavor and I would love to have it again","date":1610146475000}

My first thought was wow does anyone not know about this place yet? But that all changed as the night progressed. Our waitress said it starts getting busy here around 6pm and it really did get busy! So be sure to get there as early as you can or make a reservation.\n\nI've never been here when it was El Rincon Bohemio but the inside is a lot nicer than what you see outside. You have a choice to sit inside or you can sit outside in the back where they have patio seating with heaters all around. There's also a nice little area that could be used for private parties.\n\nOur waitress Diana was very kind, attentive and really knew her stuff when it came to food suggestions. But I did feel kind of rushed on what to order especially after we had just place our order for appetizers, and she came right back to ask if we were ready to order dinner, but I guess it's better to have that kind of service than to be forgotten.\n\nDrinks: We ordered Micheladas $6.95. I hafta say this is one of the best micheladas I've had in town! Not only was it delicious but they serve it in a huge flinstone sized mug! It's like the never ending drink and guaranteed to fill you up! \n\nRight now they only offer wine and beer but they are working on getting their liquor license. For the margarita lovers they do offer a winerita (wine and margarita mix).\n\nThe Food: Me and my friend decided to order 2 appetizers to start with. \n\nAguas Chiles -  Special of the day $9.95. I wasn't quite sure what kind of dish this was but my friend was raving about it. All I can say is that I loved it!! Think ceviche with a twist. It's marinated shrimp layered with avocados, cucumber, orange slices, and a delicious green sauce. It is a cold dish but very refreshing and it pairs well with the tortilla chips. Highly recommend this if you love shrimp!\n\nEmpanada Trio - It comes with 3, one of each with flor de calabaza, sauteed mushrooms, shrimp and a side of rice.  I thought that was pretty pricey for an appetizer but when it arrived at our table I was surprised at how huge they were! I'm thinking small tapas size but these empanadas were meal sized. I think they should add this to the entrees section instead of appetizers but that's just my opinion. I'm glad they were meal sized portions since they charge $13. Every single one of them was delicious! No complaints about any of them.\n\nMariachis: They have mariachis every Friday night starting at 6:30 and are working on getting them to perform on Saturday nights as well.\n\nOverall, I would recommend you come check this place out at least one time but like my fellow yelper Mark said it can be on the pricey side so be prepared and save up some money so you can splurge!","date":1426017107000}

The food took forever to come - seriously folks... we're talking 45 minutes for apps on a Wednesday night. But fortunately we had drinks coming from the bar, so were still happy. I was able to sample a bunch of items, so can review a variety of menu selections:\n\n- the ambience: feels like an old French Quarter house. Red walls & very authentic Big Easy vibe\n\n- the bar: good service, good drinks\n\nFOOD:\n\n- Alligator (app) - gotta try it right? Tastes like chewy chicken, or calamari... but tasty considering it's a giant reptile\n\n- BBQ shrimp (app) - these were the delish dish of the evening. Spicy & tasty (we ordered another round of these)\n\n- Goat cheese & crawfish crepes (app) - this was sort of an odd combo, but it worked! The goat cheese had been a bit over cooked so it got lumpy & the edges were too crisped & dry but it was still a tasty flavor combo\n\n- Blackened Red Fish: this was my dinner & I REALLY enjoyed the red fish, which I hadn't had before. WHat I could have lived without was the \"smothered in crawfish\", which the server had recommended. Too much crawfish - it looked sort of like a heap of dead mutant shrimp on the fish. I ate some of these, but really enjoyed the fish\n\n- Pecan Crusted Puppy Drum: Ewwwe, all I can say is I'm glad I didn't order this. Compared to the mild red fish, this literally had a nasty aftertaste. Most of us agreed this was not a fave.\n\n- Seafood Gumbo: really fishy. The person that ordered it declared it to be a good gumbo, so I'll take his word for it. It was way too fishy (not in a good way) for me.\n\n- Bread pudding: good\n\nOverall - Cajun style food is just not my cup of tea. I'm a Cali girl & like everything fresh & somewhat unfussy. The food in New Orleans is pretty heavy. Muriel's does a good job with the local flavors, they're just not my usual picks.","date":1275596541000}

I'm partial to Blanton's, Basil Hayden's and Elijah Craig but to see this niche in city like St Louis was welcomed by Sara Kulumani. I ate the polenta cakes (three for 9$) - they were delicious and i could eat them all day. Devilishly good and smelled like a charming pizza from heaven. I also got the Thai Salad (small for $5) and tacos.

It comes on a thick slice of toasted bread (the type they use for french toast), with roasted pulled pork, swiss cheese, ham, 2 fried eggs on top, with a generous portion of house green salsa slathered over the top, creating a moat of not-too-spicy green goodness. Holy sh!t. This makes me think of \"the morning after\" breakfast after partying in Miami's South Beach with some bangin Cuban honeys. Yes, it's like THAT. This sh!t is soooo bomb. I kept muttering expletives to myself as I dug through the plate with my fork. Damnnnn.\n\nActually, even better than the \"normal\" Morning Cuban... if you ask for a small cup of their House Chorizo Gravy, that's even better with the openfaced Morning Cuban than the green house salsa. \n\nOh, speaking of house, they were playing some nice jazzy\/soulful house music while I was there. Pretty nice for atmosphere. They alternated between the jazzy house and bossa nova music while I was there. I wasn't sure if it was a mix from their private collection, or if it was just Pandora. \n\nEither way, big ups for good tasting food and good taste in music.\n\nThe peanut butter brownies are good, but the rest of the baked goods didn't interest me. I think 5th St Bakehouse's strength lies not in the baked goods, but in their awesome sandwiches like the Morning Cuban. In fact, I want to go there right now!","date":1361480544000}

My friend ordered a spicy margarita which was quite strong with tequila and a nice portion of glittered rose gold salt on the rim - I took a tiny sip, she finished it. We were also served complimentary crisp fried bread (almost like a delicate puta chip?) with pockets of flavorful herbs - it came with 2 types of butter: honey miso and black bean. We both liked the honey miso slightly between because of the sweet and savory hints. \n\nWe ordered the diver scallops, chicken and snail lasagna, deep fried duck leg and the lamb loin. We enjoyed all the dishes. The scallops were thin sliced but juicy and the pop of yuzu on top added a nice tart punch. The chicken and snail lasagna was nicely layered with chicken and snail mixed in between over a nice bed of b\u00e9chamel sauce and yuzu as well - this fruit really steered a lot of our choices, the sauce also had some nutty components as well.   The deep fried duck leg came in two halves on what many would see as a hot dog bun, but both elements fried to perfection- once dipped in sriracha the juicy meat, crisp cucumber and sweet hoisin sauce blend perfectly in every little bite. The lamb loin was so so tender, the lamb belly in between was sweet and coated with crispy sesame or nuts? The layering was perfect, lamb loin cooked to medium rare all on top of the fava bean risotto which was surprisingly not heavy at all making the dish absolutely scrumptious. The consistency of the risotto was not sacrificed despite not being a grain base.\n\nLastly, we ordered the apple cake since fall is indeed apple season and it was amazing! It came with a warm apple muffin sized cake coated with a dulce de leche fused apple sauce with vanilla ice cream and shortbread crumbs on one rim and the other rim was coated and lined with dehydrated apple bites. Try your best to scoop a little bit of everything into one bite - the warm apple cake and the cold ice cream pair so well with each other. I was so glad we ordered dessert since we finished every last bite.\n\nThe service and recommendations by the waiter were great. The prices are a bit hefty, but we really liked the scrumptious dishes and the concept of sharing family style to get a taste of everything. They recommended 2-3 dishes per person and we had 5 in total. I would come again in the future to see how the menu changes depending on the season.","date":1568779877000}

We had the Sopa de Dia, which was a lentel and barley and was very good. We also had the Flautas, the Taco Pastor, The Quesadilla Tinga and the Chicken Molcajetes. Everything tasted fresh and home made. The Quesadilla Tinga was my favorite which was pulled chicken seasoned in a chipotle tomato sauce. The portions are quite large and one quesadilla and one taco was pretty filling for me. For dessert, the three of us split the Tequilla Ice Cream. This was very good also and sort of in the Bananas Foster style\n\nThis is a BYOB so I like that also. La Cinta does take credit cards.

Seriously, did I think I was going to get some good fried chicken here. The problem was I didn't pack a lunch,  I was not in a burger mood and nothing else was close to work. So it was KFC or starve to death and I am not ready to die. I have too many more Yelp reviews to write. \n\nMy lunch wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good either. KFC has just been going downhill over the years and there are just so many other places that do a better job. \nI had a Tenders combo, which included three strips (only available extra crispy), a side dish and beverage. My original side was their huge fries, but they were out at 12:30PM. Again I have to ask, Seriously? It is lunch time on a work day and you are already out of a popular side. They told me it would be 5 minuets, before they had fresh ones. I am not a patient man, I selected mashed potatoes so I could get out of there and back to work. \n\nI did notice this was a KFC that had the lunch buffet where you pay a flat fee and can eat like you are at a Hometown Buffet, but the only main entree is \"chicken\". While getting my diet Pepsi, it balances out the effects of eating \"fried food\", I noticed the sides available on the buffet.  The sides did not impress me, most looked like they were heated up straight from a can. What happened to making things from scratch?\n\nBack at work, I ate my lunch. My tenders were a nice size and crispy, but lacked flavor. The potatoes were another story within themselves. Who in the hell puts \"brown\" gravy on potatoes served with fried chicken? You'd never see that on the farm. I also hope they know they are not fooling anyone with those instant potatoes. You could not get more instant then these. Once again I have to say, \"no flavor\". \n\nKFC, there are too many privately owned chicken joints that are putting out a better meal then you. What saved you from getting a lower score then 3 was; friendly staff, clean dining area and from what I could see of the kitchen it was spotless as well. \n\nI'd love to see you get back to the KFC I remember as a child when we'd get a bucket after church and go over the river and through the woods to visit grandma.","date":1338058792000}

An exciting time to try a new restaurant!  This is their 3rd location (University City and Glen Mills I believe were the others).  The concept is pretty cool and fresh - farm to table seasonal menu with most dishes under 500 calories.  It was hard for me to not make the comparisons to the Seasons 52 concept - SO many similarities, even down to the fire, wood, stone comfy decor.  But I am a fan of both places!\n\nVanilla lavendar mojito was unique and sweet, watermelon lemon martini was very smooth and not too sweet.\n\nWaiter recommended basil pesto caprese flatbread was good.  Very flat (see pic) and light.  The other flatbreads looked compelling for a future visit - Jamaican jerk chicken and rock shrimp.\n\nWe tried the recommended Alaskan Halibut which we were told was a best of philly winner, and the cedar planked salmon.  Halibut was outstanding, on a bed of buckwheat soba noodles with a ginger teriyaki glaze.  Excellent taste and texture.  The salmon came out very well done (cedar was burned) and the waiter was quick to offer to take it back and make a new one.  The manager came over to apologize and offer dessert on the house - very nice touches and not unexpected that there will be some kinks to work out in the kitchen on Day 2.  Handled professionally and we enjoyed the meal and will definitely be back, especially since its so close to home.\n\nDessert were individual shot glass portions, nost under 250 calories.  The strawberries and cream was light and yummy, and the recommended chocolate covered banana cream pie was a standout.\n\nSo, kudos to the waitstaff for knowing the menu and being able to make recommendations, and for being prepared to calmy and efficiently deal with the inevitable growing pains.  The bar area is very nice, actually the decor of the whole place is very nice and inviting. I could definitely see meeting friends here for a drink at the bar and\/or dinner or appetizers.  A great addition to English Village!","date":1377006353000}

As a man whose favorite pastime is eating, my trips are often best recollected by my sense of taste.  I've eaten delicious chicken and beef dishes, world class mole, fresh seafood, and even crickets roasted by Mayans.  While I might get to spend one week per year in Mexico, the rest of my year is spent in an eternal struggle to find truly authentic Mexican cuisine 1,000 miles north of the border.  Luckily, in Indianapolis, the struggle ends in Pike Plaza at Carniceria  Guanajuato. \n\nCarniceria Guanajuato occupies a massive space.  For longtime Indy residents, one might remember it as being the former home of Galyan's Sporting Goods.  If you ever shopped at Galyan's, you understand what just how large this space is.  From the outside, Carniceria Guanajuato appears to be a massive Mexican goods market.  From fresh meats, seafood, cheeses, to glass bottles of Coca-Cola, if you're looking for something Mexican, you're bound to find it in the store.  However, the real magic, in my opinion, occurs in the back of the establishment.  Once you wind your way through the many isles and kiosks, you will stumble upon a huge restaurant, which is often quite crowded.  From the first moment you see it, only one word can come to mind: authentic. While the restaurant is rather loud, chaotic, and lacking of a romantic ambiance, once you're seated at one of the huge wooden tables, you know that you are in for a one-of-a-kind experience.\n\nThe menu choices at Carniceria Guanajuato are myriad.  From fajitas, tacos, and burritos to shrimp and seafood dishes, this restaurant can satisfy any of your Mexican food cravings.  However, my recommendation (which is likely the same as many other customers) is to order one of the \"meat tables.\"  This item is very true to its name: it is literally a small table packed with chicken, steak, carnitas, and chorizo.  To add to its glory, the meat tables also come with generous portions of delicious, homemade pico de gallo, guacamole, and corn tortillas.  Be sure to bring some friends with you, as I can't stress enough just how large these portions are.  For example, the meat tables don't come with serving forks or serving spoons; they come with tongs.  Yes...tongs.  A seafood table is also available.  While at Carniceria Guanajuato, you also owe it to yourself to begin your adventure with one of their famous (and very large) shrimp cocktails.  If you're dining solo, or just looking for a really healthy meal, the shrimp cocktail is certainly perfect by itself.\n\nHey, foodies!  Forget your foo-foo restaurant with its minuscule portions for an evening.  If you're in Indianapolis, have a voracious appetite, and want a truly authentic Mexican dining experience, you would be doing yourself an injustice by not trying Carniceria Guanajuato.  You'll be a repeat customer.","date":1455161148000}

Mac & cheese was dry as well.

The tour was a decent amount of time, but we thought we would get to see a bigger variety of where the beer is made. After the tour we sat down to eat and we ordered the pretzels with dipping sauce and bomb burgers. The bomb burger has to be one of the coolest burgers I've ever consumed.

I went with my girlfriend and she had the Naked Catch with brussels sprouts and I had the Hot Fish sandwich with chips.  The salmon was overcooked and it made for a mushy and unenjoyable experience.  The hot fish sandwich was perfectly crispy in a few spots, but mostly soggy and unappealing.  Another gripe which could have just been bad luck, but the top and bottom of the bun, where you hold the sandwich, was slathered in the chili sauce that spices it up making it a mess to eat.

I really want to like this place. The food is really great and the food could ALMOST make up for the horrible service here, but unfortunately, it doesn't. Went back with the SO a few nights ago and there was a line. I put my name down while the SO went to go park the car because the parking lot was full. While he was gone the host called my name and I told him that my boyfriend would be right over and that he was at his car. The host then tells me, \"well tick tock\" and points to his watch. I again tell him that my boyfriend will be right over and I then call my boyfriend to tell him to hurry when the host tells me, \"you have until the count of three\" and begins to count down. I don't know if he was joking but I didn't find it funny at all, especially as he's doing this in front of other guests. I tell the host to let the next party go ahead and so he does. When my SO gets there the host then confronts my SO and begins to berate him for \"taking so long\". He was also drinking a beer while on the job and clearing dishes with a beer in his hand. I don't know why he couldn't have seated me or why he couldn't have just moved on to the next party but I didn't appreciate the host making a scene. Whenever I've told people about this experience they've promised to never eat there, which is unfortunate because the food is so great. Get your act together, Raijin, or you'll lose customers! Don't know if I'll go back again. \n\nYou know a place is worth trying when you get there half an hour before it opens and there's a line to get in. We luckily were able to get seated right away, despite the line. The place was a lot smaller than I thought it would be and we could easily hear our neighbors conversation so this isn't a place for an intimate, quiet dinner. S.O ordered the black roasted garlic and I ordered the spicy red chili. Orders came out in less than 10 minutes in these very large, deep bowls that were incredibly hot and had steam rising from them. You know their food is fresh. Everything in the bowl complimented each other. The noodles are perfectly cooked, the pork was perfectly cooked, the broth was incredibly spicy, the pickled ginger was great, I can go on and on; this place is just amazing. Both of us have been talking about it non-stop and want to go back ASAP. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars is that because it's so small and there was a line after we were seated, you get the sense that you're being rushed out of there. I love being able to sit and enjoy a conversation while I eat and I just got the sense that the staff wanted us out as soon as possible.

Sometime in the middle of my relationship with this restaurant the service became unmentionably bad and almost literally painfully slow. From waiting outside after they've opened while they mill around and keep the door locked with out a word to us (yes they knew we were there... We waved) to waiting twenty minutes for water to even show up I've continued to patronize them because despite the sub par service the food is exceptional. They arguably have the freshest tuna in town and I know my tuna! It's also clearly a family owned operation which I'm always down to support so I've remained loyal and I even bring friends on lazy afternoons letting them know it may take a while but good things come to those who wait, however today was so terrible my taste buds are sorry to say I won't be returning. We came in with an hour an a half to spare before a movie which we planned to see right across the street, we placed our entire order immediately because we anticipated the sluggish rate of service and we waited a record 23 minutes for waters. In the mean time we watched as she went from table to table taking orders after ours. Another 10 mins after the waters were brought she comes back to tell us that her husband can't make our order because he's now too busy and needs to make only hibachi and I was so taken back I didn't know what to say we just left, but as a long time veteran and lover of the service industry myself I'm completely appalled! We waited almost forty minutes to be told our order would simply NOT BE MADE due to people who had ordered AFTER us.... I've never experienced something so inconsiderate in my life....She didn't offer a voucher or a rain check for our wasted time to show were still appreciated customers just NOTHING .... I mean what the hell??? We scrambled to find another lunch joint and needless to say missed our movie. I can deal with a lot of things for good quality food but I refuse to spend my hard earned money with people who very obviously don't appreciate my time or my years of business....

Steamed chicken dumplings were the most disappointing dish, not a ton of flavor to the chicken.  I got 1 or 2 small pieces of cartilage in mine as well but nothing that was too big of a deal.

There truly is no need for chewing. The anti-pastis (from the winter squash selection to the tartar); The pastas (from the almond tortellini to the spinach gnocchi); the secondis; the desserts....It is all in the act of savoring---letting your taste buds, palate, and brain do the tasting and processing, with very little need for use of your most handy resource during a meal (your teeth). \n\nIt just melts in your mouth. That was my experience at Vetri last night. We did the grand tasting menu: plenty of delicious food. Couldn't have been happier with the choice. My favorite were his signature pasta dishes, as well as the sweet onion crepe...my goodness, every bite is like a magical onion soup jelly bean. delicious. \n\nThe wait staff is extremely friendly and attentive.

It feels special and ritzy until a group of men in polos comes in talking 12 decibels louder than the should. C'mon guys, we're being mesmerized by flaming sugar and birds. \nWe ordered a few of the appetizers, shrimp dumplings and pomme frites (those are french fries), both were tasty and paired well with our champagne cocktails. Then we ordered the big kahuna. There's not anything called the big kahuna on the menu, I'm talking about the bananas fosters. Which was created there! That is neat. And mesmerizing once they get to it. They come out with a little burner, and a big pan, a pad of brown sugar and butter, and booze, sliced bananas. The waiter told us that the original recipe calls for more ingredients than necessary but they don't dare change anything about it. Butter in the pan, melt melt melt, mix in that brown sugar, swirl it around, then splash in that rum! And it takes flight! Not really, but we were in a bird bar so...puns. But it does flame up real high! Then the booze gets cooked down, bananas go in for just a minute or two to be covered and caramelized. Topped with ice cream and demolished in seconds. Well done, Brennan's.","date":1543959305000}

We went on a Friday night at 8:30, hoping for a nice place to end the week with a good beer and decent dinner.  We couldn't have been more off the mark.  When we entered the place, we saw an empty booth by the front window and motioned to the hostess that we would like to sit there.  She came towards us with a nasty look on her face and said, \" nope.  I need to save that in case I get a larger group\". We pointed out that she had four open tables and that it was late at night.  She refused to honor our request and was not very kind about it.  \nWe were seated at a small table that was about 4 inches away from the next table.  Ugh. The place was very loud and it was more than a little uncomfortable.  We were greeted?? By a waitress who simply asked us, \" what do you want\". We really were considering getting up and leaving but decided to stay. Mistake. The food was average at best and the service was horrendous. My husband did end up heading to the back of the house to talk to the manager and let him know how disappointed we were.  He could have cared less. Oh, and the booth we requested...

Most of my income after rent goes towards dining out.  When I went home I was ready to drop some serious money in new Orleans because I love good southern food.  So what a disappointment when I ate at this restaurant.  For these prices when it says fresh picked spinach, shouldn't it be?  But its not.  The meat is the same as any other ho hum restaurant.  I came for jazz brunch and while the band did move around they spent more time in another room than ours.  Maybe I'm spoiled from living in a area that supports local farmers but with those kind of prices my food should really be fresh picked, the meat when asked to be prepared a certain way shouldn't have to be sent back.  My food was boring and bland.  I've had better at hole in the wall mom and pop places.  I will say the building and the furniture is really lovely and the only reason I gave it two stars.  Save your money folks and skip this place.","date":1248808050000}

Her wine recommendation was spot on for my fianc\u00e9. \n\nUnfortunately the restaurant was out of about 5 menu items, which just happened to be a few of the ones we wanted to try. No big deal.\n\nAppetizer: \n\nCheeses from here and there - the cheese board was good. We loved the cheese selection and house made strawberry jam. We wanted to add charcuterie but that was a menu item they didn't have. Bummer.\n\nBacon wrapped shrimp - I don't know why but I expected more flavor. The shrimp was fresh and big, the bacon didn't have much flavor and there was a creamy sauce that was a bit bland. I just didn't get any flavor from this dish. I was disappointed. \n\nEntree:\n\nSteak Frites - we tried to order the steak cooked medium rare, but were told it only comes cooked medium to ensure it is tender. It arrived closer to well done and was tough. We didn't enjoy the steak at all. The chimichurri sauce and the frites were good. I wouldn't get near this dish again though.\n\nStrip loin - this arrived medium rare and was tender. It tasted great, especially with the smoked butter. The beans were pretty good and the saut\u00e9ed greens had a kick.\n\nWe didn't order dessert because we just weren't happy with the dishes overall. \n\nWe left hungry since we didn't really enjoy our meals. I don't know if I'll be giving them a 2nd chance. I really, really wanted to enjoy this spot and support the Hendersonville food scene.","date":1622089508000}

I went alone so sat at the bar. The ambiance is decent and the decor I like. When you first walk in the host\/hostesses are nicely dressed but then you notice that the waitstaff, bussers and bartenders are all in jeans and t-shirts, which is a bit odd for a fine dining establishment where you can easily spend $50+ per person. I found a spot at the bar easily and was greeted pretty quickly and given a drink menu. The bartender was helpful in making my decision as what craft cocktail to have first as she let me sample the grilled pineapple caipirinha as she was making one for another customer. I got the menu and took a few minutes to look it over, I appreciate that it isn't a huge menu, a simple one sided large sheet of options as it should be. I again asked for the bartender's suggestion when it came to choosing between the Salmon and the Cobia. She highly recommended the Cobia which I have never had so I went for it and let me tell you, it was so very delicious. I finished my dinner with a Rose Daiquiri for \"dessert\" \n\nI will say I noticed a few things. The bussers and servers are all in blue t-shirts and I felt like there were so many of them standing and swarming around the bar, you could tell who were primarily bussers\/food runners because they stood around a lot, so maybe they don't need so many of them. Also I noticed that a lot of people had long waits for their drinks, those at the bar and seated at tables. For a restaurant that has special crafted cocktails that require muddling and mixing and shaking (aka time) I feel they need more than 2 bartenders making drinks. If it was a busy night with a full restaurant they would have struggled much more than they did at getting drinks out in a timely fashion. \n\nOverall, I was impressed with the food and the drinks. They are still less than 2 months old so I am sure there are still kinks to be worked out. I will definitely go back!","date":1478055080000}

The portabella itself was huge, and cheap at 5.50, and then add-on toppings were reasonably priced.\nAs for the talked-up truffle fries, I'd kind of give em a \"meh\".

The rub and flavor was excellent, although both my steak and my wife's were overcooked. We had both asked for medium rare, and both were well done, to medium well at best. We informed the staff when they asked how everything was, and they kindly (and immediately) offered to replace the steaks, but it was not so annoying that we wanted new food, although for a higher end steakhouse it was frustrating. \n\nThe cocktails, appetizers, salads, sides, and desserts were all great, full of flavor, and well prepared. The bacon Brussels sprouts are awesome, so is the bacon \"creamed corn\" (despite not really being that creamy).\n\nNear the end of our dinner, they did offer us a free dessert sampler, and also took one of the steaks off of our order, which was much appreciated and I think shows that they believe in what they're selling.

And I eventually surmised she was taking a pick-up order that must have required intense focus. She was the only designated person it appears to be behind the counter but she was very determined to make sure she didn't look up to see if there were actual in\/house customers around as well to endanger her of multitasking and acknowledgment. A simple \"I'll be right with you\" solves the issue of a customer feeling ignored and wondering if they exist. \nThere was another female employee  appearing who actually made eye contact with me briefly and fussed with the espresso machine behind the counter a bit but then disappeared and had no intention of assisting me. Clearly she wasn't allowed to butt-in and take an order to assist an already busy employee. That was Single-mindness' territory. \nThe worst thing you can do is ignore a potential customer.  Mind you this was the lunch hour when a customer walking in shouldn't be a surprise. \nI was going to try this place but went to street Taco again instead, which I already appreciate for their respect of the customer.

A solid 4.5 stars for me. I've been here a couple handful of times. I really adore this bar because of their wine lists and food selections. I don't have to drive to WOB and get a house cab and a chicken sandwich when I can drop in on a Sunday night here (open til 3 AM!) and have a low sulfites, fair trade South African wine that blows my mind. At the same time eating truffle fries, local duck Mac, and tempura fried cheese curds and pickles. I'm digging their vibes! \n\nThe outside of the bar looks smaller than the inside and has this whole \"jumanji\" look going on. Lots of hanging lights and trees, darker ambiance. Outside tables and benches. When you go in it's lightly lit but still dark. Lots of shaded hanging ceiling lamps that make me feel like I'm in Casper's mansion but the underwater\/mermaid version. Again, I'm digging their vibes. \n\nYou order at the bar and they give you a number that's well seen by other staff and bring your food to you. Service is usually pretty good. Like any local bar sometimes you have to ask for plates or silverware with your meals... I used to bartend so I can empathize when this happens especially when its once or twice out of all the times I've visited. I've tried many of their burgers in the past which are big and filling. Grass fed. You MUST GET the truffle fries. I repeat. MUST GET truffle fries. Served with a garlic aioli or back of house made ketchup. They have changed their menu since the last time I was there. Looking through reviews I think they change at least twice a year. Not sure. They used to have a pork banh mi sandwich and pork belly mac that was killer. For now I'll stick with their new Mac the \"local duck Mac\" with organic duck confit, smoked Gouda (my fave cheese) and green onion. Not the best Mac I've ever had flavor wise. Needs salt or a bigger umami flavor but still VERY good. I saw price mentioned in previous reviews. With what I've mentioned and always ordered I've never had a problem or been concerned with the price to quality ratio. Just my experience. \n\nThe wine and beer lists are NEXT LEVEL. I mean truly. You can't keep me away from this place mainly because of this. Last night I ordered a pinotage from South Africa. Light tannins and medium bodied.

That's cool, I can live without a super sized cocktail. Just make me a good drink. Their cocktail menu boasts quite the list of margarita variations and for some reason I went with their skinny margarita. Definitely not the smartest decision. They take skinny margarita to a whole new level....zero sweetener. It was so sour it tasted like warhead sour candy! No biggie, I drank it. I was thirsty! Next round. I order the skinny again. This time requested more agave syrup. Drink number two was much smoother than the first and almost an entirely different drink. So, I'll never really know what their skinny margarita is supposed to taste like. Old Pueblo serves up heavy duty tex-mex cuisine. The calamari was my fave, the chips and guacamole were your standard dish and for dinner I ordered the Southwestern Steak Salad served with Arugula, spinach,  poblanos, toasted pepitas queso fresco in a sliced bistro tender steak, shaved red onion, roasted poblanos, \nbaby roma tomatoes, toasted pepitas, queso fresco and cilantro lime vinaigrette. For $12.95 the porion was quite generous. The flavors were all nice and the steak was cooked to the temperature I requested, however, I found the dressing very sweet considering it was a cilantro lime vin. And the salad was totally over dressed, making the greens super soggy. With a little less dressing and a little less sugar in the dressing I would loved this salad. \n\nOverall, the dining experience was decent. Our server was really nice and handled our group well. OPG is not really on my radar for stellar food, but I may return to try out their happy hour sometime.","date":1368775072000}

At Bibibop, just like at Chipotle, you have to make lots of decisions. Rice or noddles? If rice, then white or purple? Or would you rather have half rice and half noodles? Do you want beans? What's your protein? What toppings do you want? Do you want kimchi for an extra charge? What kind of sauce do you want? It's too many questions for my tiny, overworked brain. \n\nBut I give Bibibop four stars because what I got tasted really good. Was it Korean? Oh, hell no.

I would say that my bowl of stuff was bibimbap-adjacent, in that it was served in a bowl like bibimbap, and there was rice in it. The similarities end there.\n\nI mean, when the options that you can add to your bowl are potatoes (?!), cheese (?!?) and corn (?!?!) among other American foods, you're looking at something that is one step away from a KFC Famous Bowl. Of course, I had to add potatoes, cheese and corn to mine, as well as all of the other complimentary vegetables, because why the hell not. In for a penny, in for a pound, right? So into my bowl went cucumber, shredded carrots, red cabbage, kale, black beans, sprouts, cooked eggs and chicken. On top was cucumber wasabi sauce and yum yum sauce. My bowl was monstrous and filled with various random foods, and you know what? It tasted really good. I don't know what the hell it was, and I was agitated that I had to make a lot of decisions to get to this point, but overall, I was satisfied.\n\nThere are Korean fast-casual restaurants around town that make mean bibimbap, so when I want Korean, I will visit those places. Bibibop is a different animal altogether.

I ate here on a weekday and there were lots of tables, but I imagine it gets crowded on the weekends since it is in a great location.\n\nEveryone working here was very friendly and service was great. The menu is large and has a wide range of things to pick from. They also had a few specials of the day. \n\nEverything sounded good, but I went with a mushroom and goat cheese omelette. It was delicious and overflowing with lots of seasoned mushrooms and cheese. Eggs were fluffy and well made. I also really liked the potato hash and side salad it came with, which was well dressed. I got a side of bacon which was really delicious- I think it was caramelized with sugar and I'm here for it. My friend also enjoyed her beet and gouda salad. \n\nPrices were reasonable and a perk is that it's BYO and they take credit cards! Much better than some of the other brunch places in the area. I'll definitely be back!","date":1561050085000}

They're always pleasant when you call to place your order over the phone and patient when telling you what their specials when you ask. Tonight I had my 18-year-old run over there to pick up our order, so I can't attest for the cleanliness inside or safety precautions, but I can definitely attest for the freshness and deliciousness of their pizza and wings!!! When I placed my order I asked the girl on the phone to go easy on the pizza sauce and they definitely did. It was absolutely perfect! The crust was perfectly thin and even. There was cheese up to the half-inch crust (that they leave as a handle!). My favorite part of our pizza order .... They went pepperoni cray-cray and I have no objection to that!!! The pepperoni was definitely a double order even though I only paid for one, it was heavenly! The garlic parmesanwings were plump, crisp, fresh and full of fresh chopped garlic! I consider myself a \"garlic expert\" and I can see and taste the difference between cheap jarred garlic and fresh minced garlic from the bulb - Pomodoro definitely went all out with the fresh minced garlic... A huge win in my book! Enough to dip my crust in the spoonful of garlic left in the wing container! Good Lord, I could slather garlic on everything I eat! \nI'd also like to point out that my order was ready in the time window they quoted me. That is a pet peve when they underquote a time frame instead of being honest.\nTonight was a pizza victory for this mom. Happy hubby, happy teenagers and happy mama with a vat of fresh garlic to dip her crusts in!!!","date":1601071066000}

So 3 stars average overall. Very weird by serving the food \"family style\" despite non-family style portions. So you will wait anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes after someone else at your table already received their food. It seems it shows more inexperience of the cooks by not being able to time the meals to arrive at the same time. The waitress did warn about this but still. \n\nI ordered the scallop dish which was unfortunately undercooked and the green beans were overcooked. I sent it back and they attempted to make the dish again. However once again undercooked scallop and fried to death beans. If it wasn't for the service being wholeheartedly apologetic and removed the dish from the bill this review would've been even lower.

Menu  says it's with mushrooms and my prior experience was 6 s nails in mushroom caps. Nope this was a bowl of escargot and shrooms in the yummy herb butter in a bowl with toast. Prob like 18 snails. Way too much for me,hubs had bruschetta . His main was the special swordfish with a sauce and jambalaya. Huge! He manage to fish out all the goodies and left enough rice for another meal. That swordfish was melt in the mouth perfect. Mine was a flounder filet supposed to be pancko crust but maybe they processed the pancko. Anyway it was a beautiful,piece of fish perfectly cooked. They topped it with a mandarin orange and avocado sauce that I promptly scraped off because I wanted to keep fish crispy. It was a very yummy accompaniment. Also a kind of sweet teriyaki ,I dipping sauce, a huge mound of rice which I barely touched and zucchini  which was tasty but also a ton.

Let me preface by saying that anything good I say will be bias due to the fact that I was with grrrrrrrrrrrreat company and that can turn any experience into a good one.  Also let me preface anything bad I may say due to the fact that I'm Italian and I grew up eating my Mom's great Italian cooking (so of course nothing is as good as Mom's).  \n\nSo here we go:  I started of with a Arugula salad that was very authentic and chewy with a meaty bite to it (sorry for the wine expressions), so that was very very good.  For my main course I had the salmon & fresh herbs with potato wedges and green beans.  The main course was just OK.  Not great but not bad.  I didn't get Italian (I never do at any Italian restaurant because if I want good Italian then I go home) but I did try a friends gnocchi and I have to say I did not like the sauce.  To me it was a little acidic and tangy.  Not that it is bad but its just not the way I like my sauce (but that's why I never get Italian).\n\nFor dessert I had some tiramisu which I thought was excellent, but then again I'm not a dessert person.  I also had the bread pudding and that was tremendous and I fell in love with that bread pudding (orgasmic as one of the girls put it).  The wait staff was good, but not great, but they were very busy and they still accommodated our large table.\n\nAll in all, I want to give it 4 but its not quite a 4 so I'd give it 3.5 stars but since I'm an optimist I'll give it 4 stars.","date":1235261828000}

I've been eating it since I was 6, having been introduced to it by my Indian friends (my brothers from another mother), who's parents would take me to buffets frequently, as well as prepare it for me in their home.  Indian food is perhaps why my body never completely metabolized itself out of existence. Thank you.  SO what sets this place apart?  Well, Indian for me has always been based on the spices.  It should be spicy food and you shouldn't be there if that bothers you (seriously though spicy is synonymous with flavorful, so if you don't like spicy food your palate sucks.) I've been to this place for both buffets and dinners, both on multiple occasions.  Most Indian places that have lunch buffet and dinner service often limit their use of spices on the buffet because spices are expensive as shit (remember spice trade, giant economies being based off of spices, etc).  I know for a fact that tandoori chicken can cot over a dollar in spices for just a small piece of chicken.  This place doesn't slack one bit.  You can actually see the cinnamon sticks and coriander seeds, black peppercorns and shaved ginger, cardamon pods and turmeric root and you certainly you can taste it.  They don't even stop there, they offer to make you a homemade dosa, which if you don't know, it's basically a large super thin rice pancake filled with potato, peas, spices and more! (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dosa).  You can then dip this into numerous sauces, chutneys and soups (and it's free with the buffet!, so if they don't ask you, just ask them for one...or two ;)...).  The place is extremely friendly too (which I have found common to all Indian buffets and Indian people in general) and at this points remembers me, remembers the fact that I want a dosa and know that I am there to do some serious work on their buffet.  So definitely try this place, go to their lunch buffet and ask for a dosa.\n\n\nAlso, their dinners are wonderful and they offer a yelp deal (20 for 30) that makes it a steal.","date":1384448057000}

Don't drive too fast on route 70 or you'll pass it like I did.  But the take out only spot does a brisk business and its friendly and quick service makes it a not-too-unpleasant wait for sandwiches.  The sarcone seeded rolls that they use are great.  Most of the hoagies come in three sizes: whole (2 foot), primo (1 foot) and small).  Annoyed that the prices are not posted on the copious wall spaces....you have to look at their glossy take out menu to get their prices.  But altogether, they were not unreasonable.  The whole averaged about $17 and feeds 3 to 4.  \n\nWe got their Italian, turkey breast and Suprimo (Prosciutto & Fresh Mozzarella with Roasted Red Peppers) hoagies and they were way better than average.

My husband and I were there for our anniversary thinking, because of the trendy name and the location, it would be really nice. Now, my husband is a chef, so maybe our standards are higher then some peoples but a $14 flat bread should never have obviously canned tomatoes on it. The hummus \"platter\" was 2 scoops of hummus that they definitely did not make themselves and a few cold pieces of flat bread.

The one appetizer we wanted they were out of even though the place was not busy. Ordered the Irish nachos which were nothing exciting: freezer waffle fries that were heated up with a scoop of sour cream, pre grated cheddar cheese and a few ships of chives. What I was most interested in was the wine menu which ended up being the biggest disappointment. I saw that they had Veuve Clicquot at $48. I even asked the waitress if that was for a full bottle or a split and she replied it was a full bottle. So bring a massive fan I ordered a bottle at that amazing price and of course the waitress comes back after the manager had talked with her and says that the price is a typo. Being in the restaurant industry I asked if they would at least honor their price they have listed this once, and that that was specifically why I had asked it if was a full or split bottle in the beginning!  I was told they would not honor the price and to choose something else. What was more disappointing was that the manager would not come and talk to us nor would she look at me regardless of the many attempts to get her attention. Being in the restaurant industry is all about customer service, and with the terrible service we received it's safe to say we will not go back.

Doing so might better prepare customers for the cost\/benefit of what they are spending money on.  I am from Texas, and have had more BBQ than most of my peers, and i can say that I want Fat Jack's to survive, and have been waiting anxiously for this location to open up for over 2 years.  I was a bit shocked when I opened my to-go container at the seemingly small portion of food I received for the amount spent.\n\nThe difference I feel from a \"quantity of food\" perspective is that at most BBQ joints, I assume I am going to spend more $$ on the meal than my average meal.... however at most BBQ joints, I leave very full.  Again, at Fat Jack's, the meats tasted great, but it truly felt like the smallest portions of any BBQ restaurant I have visited over the past 15 years.  At many BBQ restaurants, I feel like the culture of the cooking\/meal prep staff is part of the enjoyment: getting to see them slap seemingly large portions of mouth-watering food and sides onto your plate or tray.  \n\nFinal Review: GO TRY FAT JACK'S.  Focus first on the taste of what you order and perhaps by the time you (or I) get there, the management has found a possible way to better provide more product (delicious as it is!) for the same existing prices, or maybe at a more \"economical\" price point to the general public.  The staff is friendly and the meats tasted great.\n\nFull disclosure: my meal was takeout and not eaten in restaurant, but on the topic of quantity of food that should not matter.  The food would probably taste even better had I eaten in there...which I will try next.\n\nNote for management: I would try to eliminate the small \"surcharges\" scattered throughout the menu.  A BBQ menu should be relatively simple.  You buy meats by the pound (or portion of a pound), or you get a combo meal.  Of course you have sandwiches and sides that is fine, but when you have all of these surcharges, you really get the customer expecting more quality and quantity...  If possible, I would immediately start increasing the portions of your sides, which I assume are fairly cheap -- this will at least look more filling to the eye and be more filling at end of meal.  I definitely think you need to find a way to increase portions of meat, but you need to determine how with your group.  \n\nAlso, I did not look closely while in the restaurant, but another joy of getting BBQ is usually walking down the counter line seeing what you are ordering.  The huge rack of ribs, the whole chickens, the sausages, the massive slab of brisket....all being cut up just for you upon ordering.  I am not sure if you have room in there to have customers line up in back of restaurants and make their way towards the cash registers (where they are now).....it would creat a natural flow allowing people to witness the action in the kitchen and see the goods you have coming out.\n\nThanks and keep on truckin!","date":1516682893000}

After going there several times, ordering a wide breadth of breakfast food, the general consensus is that the food has a generally soggy feel to it, like it was sitting in the kitchen for far too long.   The waffle was burnt on the outside, and it was still not crisp.  The menu explicitly stated that it would be served hot, but it was, at most, served lukewarm.  Along with the waffles, the benedicts, burritos, and omelettes proved to be disappointing and poorly cooked breakfasts. The only redeeming quality, and the reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, is that their fried green tomatoes are pretty good. Bottom line,  if you want to wait 30 minutes to an hour for consistently below average breakfast, go to Stella's. There is much better in Gulfport.","date":1427654195000}

The view is awesome and I would be back for drinks and mayyyybe and appetizer, but my food experience was terrible. I'll start with the appetizers we got (not pictured). The baked brie was cold and solid at the core, with only the outsides being warm and gooey like a baked brie should be. The crab cakes we had weren't bad, but they were nothing special either. If I had to do it again, I'd have them bring out more of the sauce that comes on them, as that had pretty good flavor to spice up an otherwise pretty bland crab cake. \n\nThe entrees are where things went from bad to ugly. I can make a steak at home better than what I had prepared for me with the filet mignon, and at a price of $45, the manager should be thrown in jail for theft. No flavor, poor meat quality, and to top it off, the brussel sprouts served on the side were so undercooked that they had a solid crunch to them like you were almost eating it raw. The mashed potatoes were the only thing I rather enjoyed in the meal, and you could even tell that the potatoes had been plated and had been sitting under a heating lamp while my steak was being prepared. We also had the macaroni and cheese as a side dish, and to call it a \"truffle\" mac n cheese is laughable. There was no truffle flavor in this side at all! My girlfriend said her prime rib was \"good\", but I think she was just saying that to be nice because of how much money I was spending on her birthday dinner here. \n\nOn top of the poor food experience, our waitress was very unfriendly.

My husband and I have been coming to Western Village for over 28 years.  I cannot even aptly describe the Savoir Faire of this restaurant.\n\nWe arrived at the steakhouse and we told them we had reservations. Diane greeted us and said welcome back. Diane is the manager here. She is wonderful and makes the best bananas foster you have ever had. Plus it is more of a show (entertainment) when she does it. Other waiters have made it for us but they cannot compare to Diane's. She makes the best by far. Plus she is super sweet, knowledgeable, friendly, kind and a great asset to Western Village. \n\nI love the ambience here. The restaurant is tucked away and whisks off on a culinary journey that your taste buds and stomach will applaud you for later. Once seated you can forget that you are inside a casino.\n\nAlmost as quickly as we were seated Miriam came and brought us water, bread, butter, fresh parmesan cheese, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Miriam was very friendly. Phong was our waiter. He was very professional and friendly. \n\nThe fish here is exquisite, the steaks are to die for and the desserts are scrumptious. The food is astounding. They have a delightful choice of appetizers, salads, soups, chicken, fish, pasta etc. and on occasion buffalo. Plus the prices are reasonable. If you want to see the menu and prices just go to Western Village Steakhouse and download the menu. You can find a dinner meal here for under $25. We eat here because it is cost effective.\n\nWe had drinks, an appetizer, asparagus and meal our total with tip was $110. Plus I had leftovers for another meal.\n\nMy Tip: If you like bananas then you'll love the bananas foster that is made table side here. Oh, and make reservations. \n\nIf you eat here your stomach will thank you.\n\nOne of these days I am just coming here for dessert and coffee.","date":1473357585000}

These are far and away the best I've had in the Tampa and Brandon areas. Even Ocean Prime's corn fritters were sad, flavorless balls of nothing. But The Mill really delivered! We had to wait a little extra for them, but our server came over to inform us that the chef hadn't been happy with the newest batch and was remaking them! We immensely appreciated not only being kept in the loop, but also learning that the chef has high standards for what she sends out of her kitchen. This is the mark of a great restaurant!\n\nThe big reason I can't leave a five star review is unfortunately because of my entree. My friend and I both ordered the scallops and couldn't help but just stare silently at each other when our plates arrived. There are four large scallops on the plate... but they are sitting on what looks like an entire cup of shelled edamame. Throughout the entire meal, we just questioned each other, \"Why?\" as we attempted to make ourselves eat more and more edamame - more than we'd ever eaten in one sitting in our lives. And I'm Japanese! \n\nAlso, the scallops were not seared, which is fundamental to an excellent scallop. They looked more boiled or poached (which would be fine, had the menu indicated that). The flavor was okay, but the texture was completely lacking. $18 is a great deal for a scallop dish; however, I think the whole entree needs to be re-conceptualized. \n\nWe split a campfire dessert, and it was just okay. It has several layers of flavors you'd get from eating a s'more and looks very pretty. They even add a subtle smoky flavor to it to reinforce the campfire theme. What I did not like was the strawberry coulis. Does anyone put strawberries on their s'mores? Again, the concept confuses me. It would have been fine if the coulis actually added something to the dish, but it was overpoweringly sweet and tasted artificial, like a Smuckers jelly packet you'd get at Denny's. \n\nGiven the above, I would leave three stars, but the environment was clean and well decorated. And best of all, our server was very nice. In fact, two other people topped off our waters without us having to ask, which I love! Great service goes a long way, and I'd be willing to go back to The Mill again.","date":1519349106000}

Luckily the lids were on tight and I didn't waste 84.00 and change on a doorstep. On to the food, the mashed potatoes were very dry, and taste like they had not been cooked completly. I also ordered green beans, but the container labeled GB was actually cinnamon apples. The hash brown casserole was also dry, and the quality of the food overall was disappointing.

I mean seriously, if you can give a Southern home-cooking restaurant one star because they don't serve food for vegetarians, or give it five stars because you like one thing on the menu THAT much, then clearly the quality of an establishment is in the eye of the beholder.\n\nI try not to fall into that trap, that mode.  Of course I want to give my own opinions on a place, but I also try to throw in some objective criticism.  What is the goal of an establishment?  If they meet their goal, if they do what they set out to do well, then shouldn't that count for something even if I don't fully appreciate what they put out?  It's not a restaurant's fault that they don't serve the style of cuisine a person might like.  They can only do what they set out to do in the first place.\n\nSo all that prologue-y stuff was just a set up to say that this time, I'm not really bringing anything objective at all.  I'm admitting right here that I'm purposely falling into the trap and I'm going to be as biased as I'll ever be.\n\nI really dig Joey K's in the most un-objective way possible: basically on the merits of ONE dish.  I've eaten there about five times and have enjoyed every meal.  None of the dining experiences were perfect, but they didn't have to be.  Joey K's goal is to serve New Orleans down-home comfort food in a cozy, quirky, comfortable environment, and they succeed admirably.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\nAll U Can Eat Catfish:  I recognize the bias in loving a place where I only order the same thing every time I go, but I don't care.  I love the catfish here and its price point as a meal.  It is the PERFECT value.  There is nothing elegant about the catfish they give you, but it is perfectly fried with every piece they serve being as consistently good as the next one.  It really is a fantastic way to reward your belly.\n\nAll The Other Food:  I've never ordered any of it myself, but I've had the pleasure to try other entrees that my friends have ordered.  Everything tastes simple and delicious.  Extremely large portions, no frills, and with the exception of the seafood everything is pretty much under $10.  Again, excellent value for a good coat-your-stomach meal.  Special shout-out goes to the Braised Lamb Shank special on Tuesdays.  I prefer lamb to be grilled or cooked on a fry pan, but even I enjoyed the braise here.  Truly fork-tender with a great sauce.\n\nTHE BAD\n\nNone\n\nPURGATORY\n\nNone\n\nOVERALL\n\nThere's just something extraordinarily comforting about Joey K's simple, tasty catfish.  It really just makes everything else they have moot, or merely bonus points.  I love it.","date":1285607006000}

The book said that a visit here was worth the cost of a rental car (as the location is not in the heart of the city with all the tourist stuff), and that made me take notice. Since we did have a car, we opted to head to Sammy's for lunch. Hello, delicious. My husband and I split a Ray-Ray, since that sandwich was specifically recommended. If I'd been blindly perusing the menu, I would not have picked it out myself, but it was amazing. Fried chicken breast with a flavorful crispy coating, topped with a pile of ham and swiss cheese. And the thing was HUGE!\n\nThe menu in the restaurant seems more extensive than the menu online. There were definitely more options for sides. We shared orders of baked beans, candied yams, and cornbread dressing. I wasn't a big fan of the cornbread dressing, but I wouldn't say it was bad. Just not to my taste, I guess. The baked beans had a good smoky flavor, and the yams were very tasty. Unfortunately you can't try to rationalize the yams as a healthy vegetable choice, because you just know there's a ton of butter and sugar in there making them more dessert than anything (yum).\n\nI'm dinging the place at least one star based on the bathroom. Some may find that unfair, given how much I enjoyed the food, but it's part of the experience. The bathroom was so musty and moldy smelling, it made me gag. There were a couple of air fresheners in there that were absolutely useless against the stench. (Truth be told, I could not smell them at all. I had to visually confirm the presence of air fresheners.) It was like hurricane flood waters had sat in there stagnant and it hadn't been cleaned since. It's a testament to the food that I could go back out and finish my sandwich afterward. The rest of the restaurant is swamp-stink free and seems like it was cleaned and restored well, so I'm not sure why the bathroom was so different.\n\nGo to Sammy's, enjoy the food, don't use the restroom.","date":1357230402000}

Every time I have been to sushi ai, without fail, the employees have irritated me and pushed me to my limits. They are clueless about their own menu, clueless about sushi, rude in general, and to top it all off, the sushi outright sucks. I've had frozen sushi from grocery stores that tastes 20 times better and it's cheaper as well. \n\nI don't know if ignorance is a requirement to work at sushi ai but it certainly seems like it. They don't know their own menu past the California roll, which looks like it's been thrown in a blender before it was put on my plate. I made the mistake of getting nigiri once here as well. It took me nearly 10 minutes to describe to the \"waitress\" what nigiri was, despite the fact that she stood next to a sign that listed the nigiri on it. \n\nOverall, worst sushi restaurant I have ever been to. The only redeeming quality about this place is it's location but I will never order any real sushi from this place ever again. I'm going to pop an artery next time I have to talk to one of their employees.","date":1403088709000}

Our waiter was friendly and the intimate atmosphere with the kitchen right in the same room as you was loud but I enjoyed it.  I ordered the ravioli special (spinach & cheese ravioli in a creamy red sauce) and it was quite good.  The others in my party also enjoyed their meals.\n\nThe reason I am giving 2 stars was that I did not like the way that our waiter misled us by charging us for things we did not want.  My boyfriend and I ordered the Misto appetizer.  Our waiter asked us: is this for the whole table or just for two.  We responded: for two.  When the bill came around, it turns out he charged us $16 for two appetizers instead of us sharing the $8 appetizer.  Also, as other people have mentioned, our waiter asked us: Do you want your water with bubbles or without?  We responded: without (assuming that that meant tap water since tap water was not given as an option).  We were also charged $5 for \"water.\"  We ended up talking to the waiter about the water and he removed the charge, but we didn't bother saying anything about the appetizers.  \n\nI just personally don't like feeling \"duped\" into ordering things.  I feel that it was underhanded and not necessary since their food can speak for itself and they don't need to trick people into ordering things.\n\nAlso, we were really pressured to leave even though we had ordered dessert and espresso and were still finishing up our glasses of wine.

He brought us menus and took our drink orders right away without rushing us to make a decision.  The salads before the meal were crisp and fresh (it's difficult to find a great Ceasar Salad) and the pasta dish we both ordered was out-of-this-world! Called \"The Roman,\" it was a generous portion of pasta with a spicy seafood tomato sauce. We are avid Italian cuisine connoisseurs and found this dish amazingly tasty and authentically Italian.

We expressed our excitement about our first visit to the manager when we arrived, whereupon he escorted us through the bustling but not sold-out restaurant for a quick tour and then OUTSIDE to one of the patio table areas which was completely empty. We explained that despite the patio warmers and outside fireplace, we really did not want to eat outside by ourselves on a cold evening in mid-December.  The manager was puzzled and said that people \"fight to get those outdoor tables\" (not that night, I guess). We were then offered the one table that sits directly outside of the two large swinging doors to the kitchen, which we declined. Then, we were offered one of 5 tiny tables for two that were available directly across from an empty booth which once we pointed it out, we were reluctantly seated at. A very weird and distinctly unimpressive beginning to the evening, and I still feel a little insulted and cannot understand what the manager was thinking. Finally seated, Justin our waiter was very knowledgeable and excellent. The basil bourbon drink was awesome. On to the food: Charcuturie (prosciutto, braseola and manchenga cheese) was a mixed bag, and ordinary at best; wedge salad was very good; bread basket with popovers and biscuits was very different and really good; shrimp and grits were world-class; Memphis ribs were over-cooked, dried out, not very meaty and well below average. Monkey bread dessert was outstanding. Not sure whether we will come back or can recommend Urban Grub to our friends who know food; there are too many other excellent options in Nashville.","date":1577150479000}

Upon being seated towards the front of the dining space on a two top next to two other couples we began trying to navigate the menu and how to narrow down all of the delicious offerings. As wise shopper should, we looked to our left and right to see what everyone had ordered and see if we should do the same.\n\nWe noticed one couple next to us had decided to share the ribeye\/steak. Unfortunately they were upset about how medium rare, their medium steak turned out and called for the waiter to complain. To our immediate dismay the gentleman decided to let the waiter have it even though the wait staff immediately apologized and quickly removed the steak to make it right. After the gentleman asked for the manager my wife looked at me and quietly said, \"Do you think they are trying to get a free meal?\" I dismissed it, but was wrong as the man immediately told his date that he felt the reason the steak was undercooked and not to his liking was because... (ready for this)... he was gay. His date replied, \"Do they even know you're gay?\" My thoughts exactly. \n\nOnce the manager approached the gentleman asked to speak to him away from the table and let him have it explaining how his steak was undercooked and how somehow his sexual preference must be involved. I'll be honest, it made me sick to watch it all unfold. \n\nThe manager of course helped calm the situation and replaced his waiter with another team (by the way, it turns our his original waiter was gay too) but this man didn't care and felt the restaurant owed him something. Luke bent over backwards to help this man enjoy his dinner and in the end comp'ed his meal - entire meal, wine, steaks, etc. \n\nMy review here is to compliment the manager Derrick and the servers Gary and Tristian on how professionally they managed a challenging situation. I hated to see it all unfold especially with such circumstances, but had to tell the tale that we took home with us.\n\nIf you're looking to be treated well and enjoy a delightful meal, Luke is a excellent option. My wife and I share the burger and loved the bisque, oyster salads and special cocktails. Dessert was delightful and thanks to the amazing front house team we will return and tell others our tale while encouraging others to put Luke on your New Orleans must visit list.

Hopefully they will expand their options.","date":1557511148000}

We walked and were greeted by a nice woman who had our table already set up (we made reservations). It was noon when we got there which is typically lunch time for most people. It was pretty empty when we got there but I figured more people would be coming in later (which they did ! Restaurant got packed). We were sat at our table and our server greeted us right away and took our drinks most people got water or soda and I got an unsweetened tea. Drinks were brought out in a timely manner and we were ready to order. The lunch menu pretty much consist of wraps, salads, burgers, and things of that nature. Due to the dietary restrictions of one of my coworkers they were able to get her just a piece of grilled chicken and spinach which was nice. I had the veggie burger with no bun which was surprisingly good. It wasn't just a flat piece burger with with little bits of veggies in it but instead actually resembled a burger on the outside and when you bit into it (or cut like I did) it was colorful and dulled with veggies! I was very impressed l. This usually comes with chips but I decided to pay an extra $1.50 for sweet potato fries which were excellent. I would definitely stop back into this restaurant again.","date":1556648331000}

I guess his taste doesn't change because he got, yet again, the Ribeye steak sandwich. I went off the beaten path and got a lobster salad instead of a salmon one. Wow, we can be pretty formulaic with our food choices.\n\nSince we don't get out often without the baby I figured go big or go home with lunch, which is how I chose to eat here. We only got an entree (no appetizers, drinks, or dessert) and our total with tip and tax ended up being $70. Pricey for lunch, yes, but I do feel like the quality justifies the price.\n\nMy husband got there ten minutes later than we agreed upon (I know he reads my reviews sometimes so I'm throwing that out there), so I had time to study the menu. The waitress was nice enough to bring bread, so I was in good company. \n\nThe bread was delicious. There is also cracker like carbs, but I went for the good stuff. It is a little messy. The waitress does have a crumber, but I always feel slightly embarrassed when they use it a lot around me. I love how there is actual salt on top of the butter. \n\nThe lobster salad was beautiful and delicious. There was a good amount of lobster so I didn't feel deprived at all. I really hate how there are calories on the menu because I'm a stick my head in the sand type of person. I saw that the lobster salad was under 500 calories so I didn't feel bad eating all the bread (but I probably would have eaten less bread if I didn't know the salad was so calorie conscious). They don't tell you the calories for the bread.\n\nI ate all the fat from my husband's sandwich as well, and there was a good amount of it. I thought it was delicious. The truffle fries were also very good. \n\nThis is a slower lunch. We still got in and out in less than an hour, but there was a bit of a lull while they prepared our meals. You don't come here for a rushed lunch but a leisurely meal. Most of the clientele seemed to be business people catching up.\n\nI enjoy this place, so I would definitely come back.","date":1579134783000}

However, as a Yelper it's my duty to provide accurate feedback about places I go to. Therefore... I present to you this update.\n\nThe last few reviews do not lie - service has steadily deteriorated over the last year. What's more disappointing is that the longer you've known the staff, the more they tend to  ignore you. This is a case that I've been experiencing for several months, so it  is not a recent discovery. I have waited for an improvement, but none has appeared. The only people that haven't ignored us are the sushi chefs, but that's probably because we sit at the bar every time we eat. Our check almost never arrives - on occasion it will - unless we ask for it or go up to the register. The one thing I can say is that the staff defends our service dog from anyone, and that's something I appreciate. \n\nQuality of the food has also been declining, and more recently (within the past couple of months) at a faster rate. There have been many instances where I'll taste something crunchy that's not fish or cucumber, and at one point my spicy tuna roll was much darker than it usually looked, and tasted like it had gone bad. During my most recent experience, I was served tap water - like, smell-it-taste-it tap water. I was definitely not impressed. \n\nI have no qualms about about the cleanliness of the interior and bathrooms. They're always kept tidy, and the sushi chefs wash their fish display every night right before closing. \n\nUnfortunately, I simply cannot turn a blind eye to poor customer service any longer. I would highly suggest they consult a business management and marketing trainer to develop better decision-making skills (sorry you shouldn't charge 50 cents for extra eel sauce; if anything I suggest increasing the rolls by 5 cents since the fish market is more likely to fluctuate, not condiments). \n\nI can honestly say that I don't plan on returning to Fujiyama. If I do, it will be because my ma still loves the restaurant and wants us to go.","date":1379546637000}

I would not order that again simply for the price for what you get. The Key lime pie is a must have. Probably one of the best I've ever had. \n\nFor breakfast I ordered off the menu bc I know I can't eat $22 worth of breakfast food.

Just the right amount of sweetness and not too sweet. The French fries are seasoned very well. The chicken is moist and the breading is slightly crispy! Hard to believe after all the dried out and overcooked chicken tenders I've eaten in Reno. They even lightly toasted the bun. So many little things they do to create an overall great experience.\n\nIn a world where people care less and less about quality every day, Crazy D's is a hidden gem.

It's located in one of Fort Ben's historic brick buildings, just across from Jockamo's Pizza, off of 56th street.\n\nI have been to Cafe Audrey quite a few times now and have yet to be disappointed. One thing I love is their bottomless coffee bar! They usually have 4 different choses.. decaf, a specialty, medium roast & then dark roast. Along with it, they have a variety of tea that you can have as well if you're not a coffee drinker. This especially comes in handy when there's a wait time.. you can go over to the coffee bar, pick out one of their many mugs, get your drink and then enjoy it while you wait for your table.\n\nThey serve breakfast and lunch all day so there are many options to choose from depending on what you're in the mood for. My favorite and go to meal is Florence's omelet w\/fruit and their cinnamon toast. De-lic-ious! I haven't tried anything off of their lunch menu yet because I am just addicted to their breakfast but I have heard good things and maybe one of these days I'll step out of my bfast zone and try one of their lunch options.\n\nService is quick and the food is always fresh!

Arrived around 1:30 on a Saturday and waited about 25 minutes. Not awful and totally worth it as I'll explain. Before I get to the chicken, I was pleasantly surprised at the local brews they had on tap. I live in San Diego now so I've become a beer snob. After pounding bud lights at Legends the prior night I was happy to try a locally brewed IPA. I had a Jubilee which was a lighter citrusy ipa perfect compliment to the heat of the day and the heat of the chicken.  Not a huge spice fan so went with the medium heat (options are no heat, mild, medium,  hot, damn hot) I could have gone one level up so don't be scared. As expected the chicken was perfectly cooked. Crispy spicy skin owed by moist tender meat. Hatty B's hit the mark. Sides were nothing special. I had fries and the house made slaw. The slaw was a great heat cutter when my lips began to burn. Beans were good too. But mainly it's the chicken. And he chicken was finger Likn' good. Highly recommended.

We had to pay dinner prices which I didn't understand but I went with it. Oh not to mention we had 5 adults and 2 kids so imagine the bill. Probably could of gave  us a break on the extra charge but nope. Then I checked in with Yelp and there is a 10% off for checking in and they wouldn't accept the Yelp discount which with this whole experience really upset me. Oh I forgot to mention there are no knives nope no knives you have to cut your meat,chicken etc with the one pair of scissors they had on the table yuck!!!

The salad bowl was almost empty and there was about a cup of water sitting in the bottom.  Hey, at least they rinsed the lettuce.  Toppings were old looking (tomatoes looked old, mushrooms were all brown).  The cheese was the only decent topping.  They had a good selection of dressing and their ranch is very good.  We got our salads, went to the pizza and ....there were 3 slices of one kind of pizza that had been under the warmer for quite some time.  We had to wait a good ten minutes for another fresh pizza to come out and it was burned on the edges (top and bottom).  It was an ok pizza.  Then another 10 minutes and a veggie pizza came out.  It was tasty but still burned on the edges top and bottom.  Buffet indicates selection.  I would say their selection is very poor when you have one kind of pizza to choose from for most of the time you are there.  For the money, I would not go back...IMO, a small step above Dominos and Little Caesars has better pizza.","date":1528410602000}

I finally had a real Philly Cheesesteak from Philly and it was good. I kept it simple and local. I did my search when I visited Philly and of course two places popped up, Pat's and Geno's. So I flipped a coin and got Geno's. After reading the reviews from both I figured I wasn't going to pick a bad one between the two.\nEven though Covid is a thing right now it didn't seem to slow these guys down. \nI wasn't expecting such a fast and efficient service. At one window you order and pay for your Cheese steak. The other window you order\/pay for your fries and drinks. By the way they only take cash and good luck with the street parking. Just circle the block you'll find a spot.\n \nThey have a simple menu right there at the window and there is nothing to it. I was in line for about 5 minutes and there was a couple people in front of me and during that time I was able to figure out and see what I wanted to order. Each cheese steak had an image and price next to it on the menu. I picked a regular Cheese Steak with mushrooms but what took me for a spin was the fact that they asked me what kind of cheese do I want with an option of WHIZ cheese! What? Why would anyone want Cheese whiz on a Philly? So I asked the guy at the window how do the locals eat it he replied \"with Cheese Whiz\" at that point I said give it to me. literally a minute a later I have a hot wrapped Philly Cheese Steak in my hands. Then I went to the next window and ordered my Fries and drink. Ok, so I'm not happy with the price but I will jump ahead and say the quality of the steak and fries are worth it. I spent about $18 on a combo but I would have spent that much at fancy restaurant and I'm sure it would have taken long and not be as good.\nSo how was the sandwich? It was good! It's street food and it's not a gourmet item. The Cheese Whiz melted with the heat of the steak into a salty cheese sauce that completes this Philly. I loved every chewy bite. The bread was soft and the steak was tender and not stringy. You can really taste the quality of the meat, it's not like that cheap meat you get at the grocery store. The mushrooms (if you are in to mushrooms), were thick slices and for me adds a little something extra. The fries were crispy and fresh and remined me of McDonald fries but better. You get your money's worth in fries. \n\nTo recap: Fast simple service. A little pricey but worth it. Cheese Whiz is how the locals eat it and it's worth it (you won't be sorry). Bring Cash (yes there are ATM's near by) and circle the block for parking. \nGeno's has a great Philly Cheese steak and I'm only sad that I was there for one afternoon because I would have tried Pat's the next day to compare. The next time I visit Philly I'll have to try Pat's to see what the battle is all about. Enjoy everyone.","date":1620582163000}

M&M sundae and brownie with Haagen Dazs ice cream are my kids' favorites..Very delicious.

Sometimes it's because either you\/your date doesn't like sushi. Otherwise, let's say special events and\/or nights out with friends. My visit was of the birthday persuasion. I love sushi (but my wife doesn't) so this seemed like a fun, different place to go than the usual Scotty's\/Champs\/Etc.\n\nWhen we walked in, I thought about turning around to go somewhere else, but it was late and we were hungry. I loved the comment below about this being the Denny's of Japanese Steakhouses. Dead-on. Koi pond, check. Everything else in the place, boring and plain. Not even background music? This place was DEAD on Thursday at 7pm.\n\nEscorted through the dining room, through crying babies at 2 tables. Sat at the hibachi and waited 20 minutes before the chef came out. Let's call him 'disinterested' - you know all of the mildly humorous things you expect from the guys behind the hibachi? Well, he pulled off most of them, but now imagine he's been doing it for 35 years, and working 2 other jobs. That was about the level of enthusiasm that our guy had. There wasn't a problem with the food, but this place doesn't have what I'd expect for a Japanese Steakhouse. If you just want good sushi, go to a sushi place. If you want to be bored through a half-hearted dinner, this is probably the place for you.","date":1322600750000}

It is one of those places where we are sure to run into friends any time we stop in. \n\nThe restaurant is filled with natural light during the day and in warm weather there is patio dining. At night the lighting is subtle but not so low that you can't read the menu comfortably.  \nThe bar area offers a great place for a drink and appetizers or if your dining alone. Even if you are not dining alone your fellow bar mates are likely to strike up a conversation or not mind if you do. \n\nWe have a favorite table as well as a favorite wait person, so we always try to make reservations. Though we have found all the staff to be very helpful and very professional. The Francovich's run a tight ship and much of their staff has been with them for a long time. This makes for a very good vibe, and a warm, lively comfortable dining experience. \n\nAs for the food. The lunch menu has a great selection of salads, sandwiches,pasta's pizza plus excellent specials. I really like the Burger and I always get it with the shoestring fries. The Pepper Steak starter is also a favorite of mine. Salads are always fresh and beautifully presented. I especially like the the Crab Salad and the Quail Cobb that comes with a choice of tuna, chicken or steak. Plus the Pizza's are always tasty. The Atkins Plate is also a favorite. \n\nThe menu expands at dinner with steaks, chops, chicken and a good selection of fish and pasta dishes. I have enjoyed the Cioppino among other fine offerings and the Louie-Louie salad is perfect if you want something lighter but still filling. Lunch and dinner always offers some of the best seafood dishes in Reno. \n\nHappy Hour offers half off on small plates between 4:00 and 5:30 p.m. with a good selection of tasty offerings including ahi poke, Kobe sliders and steamed clams. Drinks are expertly prepared and the wine list is well thought and offers a good selection of wines by the glass and bottle that are reasonably priced. \n\nIf you haven't been to the Grill at Quail Corners you are missing out on a fine but casually chic dining experience. So go and ask to sit at one of Sunshine's tables because we all need a little sunshine in our life. You'll be happy you did.","date":1461862566000}

It's geared toward all you can eat which to me is generally a red flag for lower quality, but I was surprised to find pretty good quality instead. \n\nBeing my first visit, I opted for the Surf Special, one selection each from the nigiri, temaki and maki areas of the menu. In plain english, the sushi (2 pcs), handroll (tapered ice cream cone shaped) and regular roll areas. I went with saba\/mackerel, honor and rainbow respectively. The last two were good if on the smaller side, I'll always choose quality over quantity, so was happy. The saba sushi...it really was rediculously small as will be apparent in the photo. I places the chopstick wrapper nearby for scale. There was just too little mackerel to overcome the rice. My suggestion, increase the fish to rice ratio so the fish stands out more. \n\nAside from this I did find it odd that neither a small house salad or miso soup was inluded. C'mon. We all know a house salad at a sushi joint is rarely more than a bit of iceberg lettuce with miniscule amounts of carrot and a slice of cucumber if you're lucky.\n\nThe really odd thing that stood out was that both house salad and miso soup are specifically excluded from all yo can eat. For AYCE, $18.99 lunch, $25.99 dinner, expect to pay $3.49 for the salad and $2.49 for soup. Both these should always be included IMHO. \n\nWould I come back, maybe. I thought quality and presentation were good, but the soup\/salad could drive me elsewhere if I were really in the mood for them.","date":1538684764000}

It is a fast-food chain, most similar to Steak-n-Shake in food and quality.  They focus on burgers that are smashed, like Steak-n-Shake, and ice cream similar to Dairy Queen.  Culver's has a well varied menu, including salads, fried fish, pot roast and some chicken items.  For sides, one nice option uncommon in Fla. is cheese curds.\n\nI had a mushroom swiss burger with the curds.  I thought the burger was good, two thin smashed patties with crusty edges (like Steak-n-Shake).  My biggest complaint is the soft, squishy bun.  I ordered ketchup added to mine, but it was left off. The curds are battered and deep fried bits of cheese. \n\nOverall, I'll take Culver's over McDonald's, Burger King or Wendy's, comparable to Steak-n-Shake but with better sides.  The ice cream is comparable to Dairy Queen, with their own version of Blizzards.  Service is better than most fast food joints, too.","date":1498416159000}

Lucky for him, because as he drove around he came across this carne asada  gold mine, and we've been bringing our family here ever since.

Wait staff was miniscule and overworked and that's why they even scored a star. I was wondering where corporate was located. Imagine my horror when I saw it was in the south here in Florida. I would think they would be located in New Hampshire with what they advertised as bbq. Sad.","date":1492654449000}

Every bite was thoroughly enjoyed and not a grain of rice went to waste. \nMy meal was tastey.  The falafel were not over cooked and hot. The hummus and eggplant were really delicious and fresh. But the best part for me were the pickled vegetables. LOL, I even noshed on my guys veggies.\nBefore we left we ordered a pistachio baklava to share. It was crunchy and a bit sweet.  Not very sticky at all. We both liked it.\nThis location has outdoor tables and very comfortable patio seating that will be awesome to enjoy when it cools down weather wise.\nWe didn't see any alcohol on the menu yet, but since there is a small bar it should be great to enjoy a glass of wine or two when they serve drinks here.\nWhen we ate our fill we still had enough to bring home.\nDefinitely we will be back again.

I really don't remember what else I ordered the first time. The second time, we ordered shrimp and pork spring rolls in addition to the banh mi and I was a bit disappointed in the spring rolls. Although they tasted very fresh (and the sauce was good), it seems like they skimped on the pork inside and the bulk of it was made up of greens. \n\nBut don't let that deter you.

Good thing to cause I was starving...my wife and I started with the fried oyster sliders and the fried whitefish (Flounder). Both were excellent, but the slider was the standout here. One per person should do it, they are actually pretty big. The flounder was very good, but I have had better. Next we shared the ribs (wow), Mac and cheese and the infamous HOT chicken (which lives up to the hype). The ribs were better than Percy st but not quite on the fette sau level. The chicken was by far and away the best dish of the night and a top 5 in Philly. The old fashioned was good but small and not as good as stateside. I would rate this place a 4.5 if yelp allowed it.

Called the front desk and they sent someone up within 10 min and apologized profusely.  No big deal.  \n\nThen the cleaning staff kept taking our soap and failed to replenish it, so we called a couple of times to have that remedied.\n\nThe food in the banquet areas was absolutely atrocious.  The only thing I was impressed with was their biscuits, and this is after 6 days of tasting their food options.  I think this is what really made the experience so bad.  \n\nThe restaurant, Kitchen Notes was painfully slow in service.  Food took equally as long.  The bar there, for the lobby was quick and efficient though.   \n\nIf Barlines has their floor to ceiling windows open, you will hear the music in your room if you're on that side of the hotel.  \n\nOverall, it is a beautiful hotel, but I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area, until they work out their service issues and pull things together.","date":1383072395000}

Fortunately, Spice Rack fulfills a much needed niche: moderately priced, extremely tasty North and South Indian food.\n\nThe owner of Spice Rack takes a great deal of pride in what he puts on his customers' tables, and you can taste it. Unlike at many other Indian establishments, Spice Rack relies on high quality ingredients, deft seasoning, and a restrained hand with fats. The result is dishes that are consistently pleasing in terms of flavors, textures, and aromas. The lamb is succulent, tender, and pleasantly gamey. My Lamb Achari had a perfect balance between richness and tanginess, and the Lamb Kadai boasted a great contrast between a sweet, smoky sauce and bright vegetables. These dishes give my beloved Asian Halal Meat around the corner a run for its money. Similarly, the \"Tikka Masala\" sauce (whether it be for paneer or chicken) is not overly rich and has a great balance of spice and tomato flavor. Usually, the dish is excessively creamy so it's refreshing to have tried a lighter version. Naans are pillowy soft with the perfect amount of paper thin crispness on the crust.\n\nThere are off-menu South Indian dishes, including dosas of every variety, vadhas, and idlis. These are serviceable and on par with other area restaurants, though I prefer Spice Rack's North Indian fare.\n\nService is helpful and ambiance is average, but definitely go here for the food, you won't regret it.","date":1348070014000}

I admit I didn't get the name until an explanation, but that turned out to be a release of some sort.\n\nNow, I'm addicted by every definition of the word. I've ordered delivery for the late-night creative crew at my office 3-4 times in the past month alone, simply because Doormet has one of those menus where *everyone* can find a favorite. From order to office-step, it's about 45-70 minutes.\n\nOn my own, I've stopped in for lunch takeout and ordered delivery for home. Always good.\n\nA few standouts:\n\n - Doormet delivers wine. Sa-weet, esp. if your racks are empty. \n\n - Caprese salad rocks. Granted, I alter the original version (due to my aversion to avocado), but it still is a uniquely delish MEAL ... versus just the starter you'll find at most restaurants.\n\n - The Truffle Mac 'n' Cheese is sinfully delish. So are the Crispy Potatoes. Side note: The sides, in general, are relatively inexpensive ($5 and $3), so there's no harm in trying all of them at some point or another (which I have). :)\n\nOne wish-list item:\n\n - More shrimp and seafood in the entree section are extremely welcome. Sometimes I'm craving something more robust than a salad and a side, and chicken doesn't cut it. A shrimp pasta or a grilled fish entree would be divine. I'm sure there's probably a challenge with the freshness thing, but I think I'd rather hear of a sell-out due to limited quantities than avoid a restaurant altogether due to a lacking menu.","date":1319401416000}

One of the best I've had, it was so tasty I wondered if they put meat in it or used some beef stock.  If you are a vegetarian you should ask.  Be cautious with your ordering as the chips and an entree will be more than enough to keep you full.\n\nI've only had pupusas at one other place and I was not a fan, but luckily my opinion turned when I tried them here.  We ordered the pupusa with cheese and vine vegetable, the pupusa had a nice texture and flavor almost like a chinese bao but flat.  Unfortunately our pupusa was served without any sauce or salad\/slaw which I think it was supposed to.  However, it was still tasty and I would go back to try the other pupusas.\n\nWe also tried the baleada with egg and chorizo, in terms of flavors nothing stood out, but it was very delicious.\n\nThe specials board advertised pastelitos hondurenos which we smartly ordered.  It was like fried chicken in a tasty dough.  I think the server was nice enough to put four to our order instead of the usual three since there were four of us.\n\nFor entrees, we limited ourselves to the seafood soup and a paradilla platter.  The seafood soup was absolutely delicious.  A very flavorful stock that wasn't too fishy and it was a never ending bowl of seafood.  When I go back I will order this just for myself and not share!!  The paradilla had steak, pork, and chicken.

When the waitress finally came by, she admitted she had forgotten about us.  A few minutes later, she brought out a biscuit and said it was for her error earlier. That would have smoothed things over until I saw her bring them out to everyone else, too.  Either she lied or screwed everyone.  Our entree came out in an appropriate time but we had to ask our runner about the salad.  The waitress came over and said she didn't know what was going in the kitchen.  Um, shouldn't you know the status of your orders and check on them?  A few minutes later, she brought us out the salad.   That was the last we saw of her.  Beverages empty, we had to flag her down.

She had just given birth and was re-settling. I won't bore you with the communication details at this time. \n\nDay of the wedding. She texts  that the cake, would be delivered when the reception was 30 minutes prior to start or 30 minutes prior to our dinner open. This way, she assured us, the cake would be \"Safe' as she didn't trust it sitting alone with waiters walking around and no one really attending to it. Ok, this made sense, I suppose so we went with it. So, 30 minutes prior to my sisters reception, there  I was, waiting... NO CAKE , NO GRACE!  We called her and she had all sorts of excuses why she was running so late. The parking garage entrance was changed, traffic, etc. She said that she had called the restaurant to let them know she was in route...restaurant was super professional and I was right there at front desk...well of course...they denied her ever calling all day,  like she claimed to, but whatever..\n\nAt one point, she told me \"Im, in the car, I'm mustering the strength to bring your cake in\" I was like WHAT!?? frick! I WAS CALM BUT FREAKING OUT! My sister was due to walk into the restaurant any second! NO CAKE!!!\n .  \nI told her multiple times I would walk down and help her take cake in! I WAS DESPERATE TO GET THE CAKE!  Finally by third phone call, she is at the correct parking garage and I RACE through the casino, to the parking garage, to meet her.  Literally,. She lifts the cake out of her car, out of her car, and  carries it in. No cover no nothing! Just, mid-air through a crowded casino!  My sister and I escorted the cake and her through the hotel.  I was daggered anyone,  who stepped in her way, worried they may make  her TRIP!  Oh my goodness!  We had to walk, with an open cake, as my sister carried the cake topper, I cleared the path, as we crossed steps, the crowed casino , lines , etc just to get it to the restaurant. VERY STRSSFUL!\nThe cake could  have been wheeled in  on a cart maybe? No wonder she needed her strength!. Her previous comment made perfect sense now. \nHer final excuse for the tardiness of the cake.??.Apparently the wedding before us, had given her the incorrect address to their location, which set her behind schedule  to us\"  Our cake ended up being an HOUR  late ! \nWe were very lucky that my sister ended up taking longer with the photographer than expected or else the cake would have arrived at the time she was already seated. My sister arrived within 5 minutes of the cake being delivered\n\nThe cake itself looked like it had been put together in one hour or less. It appeared unpolished and lopsided. I cannot post pictures, unfortunately. . Perhaps,  most guests didn't notice but we sure did, and it was my sisters wedding cake, and for her, the cake is an important visual element in her wedding. I chose Grace Bake Shop because of her artistic ability in her cakes. She assured me that she designed and created all her cakes. CLEARLY she hadn't done this one because this cake shouldn't be in her portfolio. It looked like a beginner level cake. \n\nMy advice for Grace: You have had great reviews in the past. Your cake taste great! You definitely need to cut back your orders or be perfectly honest with the client two days prior or even a day prior if a crisis or emergency occurred in your life at the time your cake was due. Easily we could have found a way to re-book with another bakery as my sisters design wasn't all that complicated and yet the cake turned out looking sooo \"Amateur\" and clearly not resembling anything close to your photo gallery.","date":1466443024000}

I like how the bars are seat-yourself.  My gf and I came here for dinner one evening after shopping around at the mall.  We were lucky to find a booth within a few minutes of looking around the bar area.  The waitress we had was very nice and taught us something about Seasons 52 we never knew!  Everybody that has dined with S52 before are probably familiar with the face that all of their menu items are under 475 calories.  However, something many people don't know is that a lot of their food items are sourced locally.  Even more pleasing to know is that they are very allergy-friendly!  They have a different menu set aside for vegetarians, vegans, low sodium, lactose-intolerants and even for patrons not liking garlic!  If you have allergies against shell fish or other severe allergies and dietary restrictions, they'll actually prepare and cook your food separately to deter any contaminations with other foods in the kitchen.  I wish S52 would advertise the uniqueness with their menu as I feel it would greatly encourage more to dine with them!  As always and expected, the food and service at S52 is always top notch and the ambience always inviting and conversational.","date":1374451958000}

The tables for eat-in were blocked off, I assume its because of COVID.  I put my order in and waited about 10-15 mins for my sandwich.\n\nWhile I waited I checked out the inside, I could see Amoroso roll boxes, mostly domestic beer and an assortment of different fruit liquors in the coolers and they have lottery.  The inside has seen better days.  The cooking area looked pretty clean, and they sell rap snack chips, Herrs as well as Wise chips.  I grabbed a bag of Notorious B.I.G. cookout BBQ chips which weren't too bad.  Haven't seen the Rap Snacks brand in quite awhile.\n\nThe cheesesteak wasn't great, wasn't bad, the bread was fresh, hot peppers had decent kick and the American cheese was nicely melted in with the roll and meat.  My biggest issue was with the meat.  I had at least five or six fatty pieces I had to spit out.  Sorry to be graphic, but I think the lack of quality meat killed a couple of stars here.  It wasn't all greasy and drippy which was a good thing, the sandwich looked good, but the meat was just a big downer.  \n\nEvery place has it's off day, but I wouldn't repeat.

The views were amazing, but everything else felt... uncool.\nI ordered a salad and appetizer, and my partner ordered a philly cheese steak sandwhich and a manhattan. The spinach artichoke dip was the only highlight. The food was so boring that neither of us finished it. I wouldn't say it was \"BAD\" food, but I would never say it was good.

The food looked great and an excellent rating on Yelp so had to give it a shot.  Was expecting a fancy place based on the ratings but was a little quaint house. We were early for our reservation but the staff immediately took care of us and set up a table.  Started with mushrooms in a garlic and butter sauce and the ham croquetas. Both were amazing. Mushrooms cooked perfectly and so tender. That garlic butter sauce was just mild and tasty. The croquetas was also not a heavy ham taste. Crispy outside, moist inside. Great start. Next was a clam soup special. Also delicately flavored with a little spicy kick. Not a thick soup which I like. Again another great dish. For the main course I got the sizzling garlic shrimp. Had this once in Europe and thought it was a Portugal dish not Basque. Again this was great.  A little bread left from the mushrooms was so great to sip up some of the broth in the bottom.  We got the baby squid in ink sauce to share. The squid  legs were cut off and stuffed with some other goodness inside the body and then cooked in the ink sauce. This was the only dish that was so so for me. Way too much sauce and the ink sauce was a little sweet and needed something a little savory added for me. Hard to really taste the squid with so much sauce.  Would've been great with less sauce and maybe some type of pasta possibly.  All in all this was a great surprise find and the little house made it a fun place to check out.  Give it a shot if you're in Boise.","date":1576288097000}

I've eaten dinner here twice, and expect to return over and over. So far I've tried 3 pasta dishes (including my husband's): I loved their fusilli with an earthy, complex-tasting bacon onion tomato sauce - I ordered this dish b\/c I was looking for a simple carbo loading dish a couple nights before the Broad Street Run- and was surprised how tasty it was, and a bargain at $13! Last night i had their Thursday night pasta special, a wide tube pasta with meatballs, and DH had the linguini with sepia (fresh cuttlefish, which is like calamari-who knew!) -- our waiter said all pastas except penne are made from scratch-- they definitely tasted fresh, with a perfect bite and texture. Also tried their hot & cold antipasto, featuring both grilled and fried calamari, plus a nicely varied assortment of cheese, olives, roasted peppers, and cured meats. The grilled calamari was perfectly charred, the fried was crisp and hot, without any greasi- or sogginess-wonderful!! Their walnut goat cheese salad was generous, even when split for 2, the greens fresh and perfectly dressed with a homemade vinagrette (not the cloyingly sweet bottled variety i hate) and wholewalnut halves that even seemed fresher than the normal out-of-bag grocery variety. It was outstanding. Split a tiramisu, which was perfect in every way. \n\nMy only criticisms, so far, are of the caponata, bread, olive oil and butter (the free stuff, so I can't complain too much!) they bring before the meal: The caponata is a pretty tasteless mix of sauteed (not roasted) chopped peppers - it could really be jazzed up with some red pepper flakes and garlic. The olive oil they serve is also tasteless, like non-evoo you \"might\" cook with; the butter comes in the plastic single serve mini- tubs you might get at Denny's; and the bread, tho fresh and soft, seems like little more than a hoagie bun sliced up... These things seem cheap and bland and therefore out of sync with the rest of the great menu Spasso offers.","date":1338046953000}

A few months out, as a junk-food connoisseur who has sampled Hostess's former competition, I've got to say none of the pretenders to the throne -- not Entenmann's, not Bluebird and most certainly not Tastykake -- produces anything that approaches the finesse of Hostess. \n\nIt's the little things, the details that tell the tale. Tasty Cakes lays an extruded roll of chalky fondant (with lots of air pockets in it just so you know for sure they don't have a clue what they're doing) on their cakes and chops it off square at the edge of each cake. Lest the fondant fall off, the cake is then apparently mashed down. Real what-do-you-want-for-a-dollar craftsmanship there. \n\nTheir white cream filling is light gray and oily looking. By any objective standard, one would say the emulsion of this creamy goo is broken, either from the incompatibility of ingredients, exposure to heat, or over-whipping. This is rough, amateur stuff at which any commercial bakery should be past masters. Say what you will, but Hostess had all this fumbling decades behind them. They made a glossy, professional product, comparatively speaking.\n\nTwo points earned by Tastykake bakery because sugar is, irreducibly, sugar, and many people eat junk food for the sugar fix. But the flavor and finish of Tastykake leaves the entire culinary pleasurable-to-imagine experience to be desired.

We'd heard lots of great things about it but questioned if it would live up to the hype. Quick answer: It does! \n\nWe strolled in just before 7 on a Friday night. We were told the wait would be at least an hour, but the hostess worked her magic and got us seated at a cozy table for two in just a few minutes. As we surveyed each section of the menu, certain dishes stood out.\n\nWe started with the burrata with butternut mustardo, crispy Brussels sprouts, and fried hazelnuts. It's such a simple dish but was superb; we would discover this level tone par for the course at Silo! The flavors complemented each other nicely, and the dish had just the right amount of crispiness and saltiness. \n\nFor our main dishes, we went with the roasted pumpkin curry with kaffir lime leaves, seasonal vegetables, pepitas, and jasmine rice, and the grilled 12 ounce pork chop. The pork chop was accompanied by smoked blue cheese, roasted pear, polenta, chard, and fig sauce. My boyfriend said it was the best pork chop he'd ever had, and my pumpkin curry also was quite memorable - just the right amount of sauciness. Again, the flavors were perfectly balanced, and the pepitas added a nice crunch. \n\nTo finish our dinner, we split the chocolate bombe tart, which includes dark and milk chocolate mousses and Luxardo cherry sauce. We agreed this dessert had the optimal mix of textures between the two mousses and the crunchy crust. \n\nOh, and I would be remiss if I failed to mention the corkage fee of $20 per bottle and our outstanding server, Hannah. \n\nBottom line: Silo lives up to the hype. The food, service, and ambiance all are top notch. Do yourself a favor and get there.","date":1483197302000}

Tonight's soup was clam chowder. I had the G&N Heartburn with garlic fries and a cup of chilli (which came with a corn bread muffin). \n\nMy wife's meatloaf was fantastic--I tried some and its honestly the best I've ever had. Great mashed potatoes as well. She said she really enjoyed the cole slaw (she said it was excellent and she's picky about her slaw) and the soup was good, if standard, clam chowder.\n\nMy meal was amazing. The chilli, which came with diced onions and shredded cheese, was outstanding. And the corn bread muffin, oh my god, it was too die for. Moist, tasty, and delicious with some soft butter to go with it. The heartburn sandwich was great too. Heaps of try tip, peppers (red and green), horse raddish, and tons of cheese on toasted bread. It was amazing and very spicy, as advertised. The garlic fries were standard garlic fries, and were tasty enough. \n\nWe ended up having plenty of leftovers, as both meals were huge. Despite all the food, we got out the door for $30 plus tip. Bargain. Service was efficient, friendly, and fast. \n\nI noticed its been getting kicked around on here lately, and I was wondering whether something had happened here.

The shrimp was tempura, I really liked that, but I'm fairly certain it said it came with some sort of mayo (and there's usually some sort of delicious sauce on it), but there were nothing, kinda bland, nothing special.

Only thing that stopped us from just leaving was his hunger. Unfortunately his was actually missing the avocado in it.\nI stop the waitress and complain to her, saying it took fifty minutes for him to get his food, and I was even finished my food long ago.

She just kept making excuses and arguing with me. NOT the way to handle that situation, you're supposed to find a way to make the customer happy, not argue with them.\nSafe to say that in the end she got a two cent tip, and that was only because we had no change.\nGenerally how it works\nGood\/awesome service = 16-20% tip\nAverage service = 15% tip\nNot very good service =  10-14% tip\nWorst service I've ever experience = no tip at all.","date":1350166069000}

That's what you're going to get here. If barbecue is  your flavor then you enjoy this restaurant. It is nice and simple no bells and whistles. Located down the street from the Reno Aces stadium The restaurants right on the corner of 1st Street. They do have their own parking lot but it is a half block down towards the stadium. \nThere were a lot of interesting appetizers that I will have to try when I return. We had a limited amount of time so we just got sandwiches. We made the happy hour, so we started with one of their three dollar margaritas and wife got a beer. The kids menu was nice ( not healthy, but it is a BBQ joint ) so we weren't there for healthy. My son got the ribs and fries. The server let him taste the sauce first to make sure it wasn't too spicy. It was two very hearty ribs and an order of fries. \nThe server are extreme friendly and helpful. Ours told us about their \"football sandwich special.\" They have a number of sandwiches that are normally priced at $10-$12, but if you get them under the \"football special\" they are $10 and come with a draft beer. I got a pint of 1554 which went great with the sandwiches. \nMy wife got the beef brisket sandwich with cornbread which was not part of the football deal. I got the pulled pork with fries which was on the deal. \nThe beef brisket is very tender and has a great smokey hue. It is quite hardy. The flavors of the pulled pork really came together with the coleslaw topping. The bread on both sandwiches is a lightly toasted soft French style roll. The perfect amount of soft and crispy.\nTheir french fries are \"steak fry style\", larger and more of a baked potato flavor. They appear to be made on the property. They were a little mealy,  which you get from fresh made fries. So I would recommend having them done extra crispy. \nWe look forward to returning and trying some different items. Make sure you bring your appetite.","date":1410029188000}

Food was always great - but the problem wasn't the food with us.....\n\nWe used to order hoagies, fries, onion rings, wings, etc. for our family often for weekend dinners - and this place was one of the tops on our list.  However, never again.  About a year ago one Sat night we placed our order, call it an approx $65 order.... I picked up and paid with a debit card. No biggie, right?  \n\nSo a few days later, looking at our bank account online, I noticed that the charge that hit our account was actually $30 more than the order.... Huh?  So I double checked the receipt and sure enough, yup - food + tax = $65.   I do the double take and the charge was $95.  My wife called them to get them to fix it - and sure enough, big apology, it was a mistake, etc. etc. and she was told to come to the store and they'll just give back $30 cash.  Ok, mistakes happen - done.  \n\nSure enough about 3 months later - same thing happened.  $30 more than the bill hit our card. My wife called again, gave them the scenario - and she was told that it was a mistake, probably added it as a tip by mistake because there was a table sitting and he probably charged our card for their tip in error blah blah blah....  So I thought back to that Sat night when I picked up - and I do remember a table of 4 sitting eating.  Well, it's highly unlikely that they ran a tab that would have generated a $30 tip (i.e. A $150 food bill with a $30 tip added to it).  So frankly it was a total BS story - nonetheless my wife went back again and got the $30 back.   There's no way it was a mistake - second time around for the same amount within a few months.  It's stealing is what it is.  \n\nSooooo - a few weeks after incident #2, we're talking to neighbors of ours telling them the story.  Well guess what?  Same thing happened to their other friends.  Not a coincidence.\n\nWe haven't been back since and I'm shocked that they haven't been busted.  Sad, because we always liked the food, the environment and even most of the workers.

We ordered not one bottle, but two...but he came back to the table 10 minutes later (on both occasions) to say the wine was sold out. He did not know the cheese & meat plate items and could only identify 75% of what was on the board. \n\nBut alas, the food shines so brightly that I could not bare to give this place less than 4 stars. The fried artichoke appetizer is a winner and was enjoyed by everyone at the table. The cheese & meat plate was a great way to start the meal and contained a nice selection. \n\nOnto the main course - I had the scallops and they were perfectly cooked and came on a chorizo\/fava bean succotash. Delicious. My brother & dad had the duck (which I tasted), it was impressive and paired well with the pumpkin risotto.y brothers fianc\u00e9e had the pork chops (served crown style) and they were charred just enough to give a bit of crunch - also paired beautifully with sides. My mother had the grouper with roasted cauliflower. It was tasty, but my least favorite of the dishes on the table. \n\nAs for deserts, we were underwhelmed by the apple tart. It is quite small in portion size and the filling was just mehhh. We also had two slices if the seasonal carrot cake. It was tasty but definitely more of a spice cake than a carrot cake. It was very brown in color and there was no visible indication of carrot in this dish.\n\nWe had two of the craft cocktails, of which I can't remember the names.

Now on the tacos, we were told we couldn't modify any of the tacos because they \"Just Make Them\" and bring them out but we were never told this before paying our money. We don't eat pork and my wife has a food allergy with avocados so when we asked what was on the tacos we got hit with a rude comment and attitude.\n\nThis is from my wife's review:\n\n I wish there was a way to give this place NEGATIVE stars. Pi** poor service and too many rules for something I'm paying for. So, my husband and I dropped into this place this past Thursday night. Our attempt was to give taco night a try. So based on the website, a lot went downhill off the bat. Cover is NOT $6 as it says on the site...it's actually $10. No one informed us we could've paid the cover on a tab we started instead of rummaging through our pockets and purse looking for scarce cash like homeless people. Bartender then tells us the drink specials (which partially didn't match their site) and the bare basics of the taco special.\n\nWhen I asked about the contents of the tacos, I was met with irritation. She was annoyed that I was asking. She couldn't tell me about the slaw that apparently comes on EVERY taco. She then proceeded to ask me, \"what are you trying to figure out?!?\" I said excuse me??? I proceeded to tell her about food allergies and dietary restrictions (like the fact I don't eat pork and haven't for about 6 years) and OVERALL INTEREST BECAUSE I'M PAYING FOR THE DOGGONE TACOS SO I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW!!!! Then, she says \"Well I'll try to make sure things come out according to your specifications because we premake them and just serve them.\" I DON'T CARE! \n\nTHEN...we finished the first batch which was a beef and a chicken. They were decent. She brings out the next (of the exact same thing despite their being 5 varieties) and my husband asks if his next round could be both chicken instead....ANOTHER employee CUTS him off and tells the bartender \"nip this in the bud because we don't' even do special orders\". I then said, please close us out and give me my tab please. I was told there was no need to close out and she tried to explain, I told her \"honey I don't care, the manner in which this is happening is unacceptable, close me out now please\". \n\nNeedless, to say I will NEVER be returning...lackluster service and overall lack of concern for us being there and below average tacos doesn't exactly make me wanna gas up my vehicle and hurry over there.

It loses 3 stars, purely for bad service. \n\nI visited this place on a Sunday afternoon, along with 4 others. It was pretty slow, so we were instantly seated. Our waitress greeted us and took our drink orders. We all ordered a soda or water, except 1 friend, who had ordered a pitcher of their blue lit long island iced tea. When the drinks arrived, we placed our order, and after sampling my friends blue drink, I ordered a pitcher of it as well and asked for napkins, since we used our to clean up a minor spill at our table. Food didn't seem to take too long to arrive. We had all finished our first drinks by the time our food arrived. Our waitress came back just as the food arrived to ask if everything was alright; since we hadn't really had the chance to check or eat anything, we all just nodded, and she seemed to almost vanish instantly. \n\nWe started to eat and were very happy with the quality of food; but more on that later. We finished our meal about 20 minutes later, and still had not seen our waitress to ask for a refill of our drinks. At this point, I realize that I never even got the pitcher of alcohol or the napkins I had ordered when she took our food order. We attempted to flag her down from across the room a couple of times, but it seemed like a waste of time. One my friends actually got up and refilled our drinks at the server station across the room. This is when she finally arrived back at our table. She apologized for her absence and mentioned something about being swamped with guests... to the sound of crickets chirping. We had told her that we enjoyed the food and inquired once again about the napkins and the pitcher of alcohol I had ordered. She said she would get the alcohol and napkins to us as soon as the drink was made. We sat for another 15-20 minutes, cups empty again, still no napkins or alcohol had been delivered. A friend finally went and tracked down the manager and brought him over. We had told him that our waitress has been too busy to check on our table and we were refilling our own drinks, and were still missing the pitcher of alcohol I had ordered about almost an hour ago. He apologized to us and said he would comp the pitcher of alcohol and told us if there were any other issues, to come and find him. The pitcher arrived... finally. At this point, we had spent an spent a little over an hour at this place. We asked for our check to be split in 2 and waiting another 15-20 minutes for that to finally come back. We looked at our checks and found that my friend was charged for 2 pitchers of alcohol, and I was also charged for 2 pitchers of alcohol. We were also both charged for large Caesar salads, when we had asked for the smaller side salad. The waitress came back and said she would fix the errors. When she came back, the salads were changed to small side salads, my friend still had an extra pitcher of alcohol on his bill, and I still had a pitcher on my bill. The manager came back to our table and told us he would fix it. This took another 2 attempts, but they FINALLY got it right. Apparently they though we drank 4 pitchers of long island iced tea, when we barely managed to even get the 2nd one before we wanted to leave.\n\nSince the napkins I'd asked for over an hour ago never arrived, condensation from the pitchers and glasses had the table looking like it had rained. \n\nThis is the first time I haven't left a tip for a waiter\/waitress. \n\nOn our way home from the restaurant, we realized that there were 2 other things that never came. We had order the burger sliders; just to try them. We asked for them to be brought out with the meals as well, but they never came. Luckily, we weren't charged for them. My other friends had ordered the kids meal for their son, which was supposed to come with a dessert  included, but that never came either. I don't know if this was her first job or just first time serving, but it was horrible. Both myself, and my friends girlfriend have been servers at restaurants with a higher volume than this, and could not imagine a valid excuse for this kind of service. \n\nNow for the food...\n\nI had the calamari which was very good. Cooked to perfection! It came with a sweet Thai chili sauce, which was amazing! I also had the seafood macaroni and cheese. Everything about the dish was great! I was afraid the scallops would be chewy\/rubbery, but they were perfect. Should I find myself back here, I'll have to get it again. \n\nI'd definitely visit this place again. I will not accept being served by that waitress again though.","date":1370950942000}

It's a towering monstrosity of bun, beef, cheese, bacon, tomato, roasted poblano, grilled onion, raw onion, and lettuce.  The toppings were generous and combined were delicious.  I admit that I had difficulty putting such a behemoth in my mouth, so I found it helpful to remove the lettuce.  The appeal here is the combination of flavors; the beef itself was tasty but was part of the chorus rather than the lead singer.\n\nThe meal comes with chips, though I ordered the fries instead.

Service and food became less than stellar; every time we went they forgot sides we ordered, didn't refill our drinks etc.- so we stopped going there regularly. Today at 2:15pm we decided to give it another go, and we're so sorry we did. From the moment we walked in the door, the staff was audibly upset about our presence. From the lobby to our booth we could hear several employees complaining, \"uggghh... another table\" \"I don't want to be sat again\"\"why do people keep coming?!\" \"MORE PEOPLE\" \"this is so crazy today\" \"I just want to sit down and eat my lunch\". There were about 4 other tables there of people eating at the time. Look, I get it. We all have been there- long day, rude clients, coworkers not pulling their weight, bad days, exhaustion... I work too, and I have had those days where I wish it would just end already- BUT if I ever hear my employees say this stuff in front of clients, or if my manager ever heard me talk like this in front of people, it would be unacceptable. So at this point my husband and I felt uncomfortable and knew they didn't want us there. The waitress seemed nice to our faces and took our order. We got one partial refill on our coffee after only drinking 1\/3 of the cup and only being there about 5 minutes. Our food was dropped off and SO WAS OUR CHECK. She said she'd be around if we needed anything- BUT SHE LITERALLY TOOK OFF TO EAT HER OWN LUNCH. She never came back. The staff were all loudly talking about their busy day and how it was 3 o'clock. The hostess decided to use the phone and computer in the main dining area, and ask (very loudly) how to run the numbers from today's sales because it was \"so crazy\". One waitress was still working and waiting on the other tables there, so it wasn't like we were the last table taking our time- we really weren't there more than 40 minutes total at this point. Our waters and coffees were empty. I needed a box. I watched her go from the booth behind the register to behind the counter to get herself a Pepsi and go back to enjoy her lunch never even glancing at us to see if we needed anything. Finally the other waitress asked if we needed anything after I stood up to pay the bill. I said a box. Our waitress was chowing down and yelling across the restaurant \"thank you so much Anna banana(and continued to rhyme her name).\" She could've said, \"I have to go on break now but our other server will be available if you need anything\" and it would've been fine. But she didn't. She left us. She was mentally done with her day which was abundantly clear when we heard her complaining and when she left us sitting there without water or the option to bring anything home. The name on the check said our server was Kelly K. She wasn't a teenager with a summer job, she was a full grown adult. We left at 3:10pm. Again, we've all had bad days at work, we've all been starving and waiting for a break- but this was super unprofessional, and there are plenty of people out of work right now that would be glad to be getting a paycheck. We will not be returning, and there are plenty of places in the area that offer great brunch that won't make us feel like we've interrupted their meal.","date":1597614606000}

They come with a hazelnut crusted strawberry and its like a dessert in of itself. I wish they just had a bar because I would skip the food and just come for the chocolate martinis. \n\nI have a pet-peeve when a plate or platter is served to you and its bigger than the table top you're sitting at. Max Brenner does this. We had 3 people at a 4 top table and had to put all of our cool, but humongous plates on an angle to get them to fit. I can't imagine what it would have been like if we had a full table of 4. The place just gives you the constant feeling of being cramped to the point where you're running out of there after paying the check to get some fresh air.\n\nThe food is ok. The prices are a little high for pizzas and sandwiches, but they do give you a big portion to make up for it. Every dish incorporates chocolate to some extent, which is creative, but nothing really wowed me. \n\nI think this place needs to expand. Its too small for the amount of tables they have squeezed in, not to mention the chocolate store\/waiting area in the front.

My friend Sharon and I have wanted to try the place since it opened and I have been thwarted numerous times: they're closed on Sundays, there's a blizzard, it's too far... etc.\n\nWith the menus posted on chalkboards and the central coffee bar a prominent feature, it seemed like you would order at the counter, but no. I was surprised when our server offered us actual menus and asked us to take our seats, he'd be over to take our order soon. Half bistro, half restaurant style? The place was only a quarter or so filled on the Monday night, with most sipping coffee, on laptops, or catching up with a friend. Only a couple of tables appeared to be there for dinner.\n\nThe appearance of the menu eerily reminds me of Famoso's menu, a trifold mix of soups and salads, pizza and pastas, and little icons to indicate vegetarian or spicy dishes. Either they're both using the same standard template, or this was an intentional replica. The menu items themselves are similar, as they both serve Italian cuisine.\n\nTo start, we shared the salmone bruschetta: smoked salmon with a dill cream cheese spread, capers, red onions, and a small mixed green salad. Although a classic combination, the dish was mediocre. I could have used more dill, less cream cheese, and the single piece of red onion seemed an odd way of presentation.\n\nWanting to compare their pizza to my usual order at Famoso's, I ordered the Calabrese pizza, a cream sauce, bocconcini, proscuitto, and arugula. Very similar in taste but the richness of the cream sauce and the larger portions of bocconcini made me prefer the lighter Famoso version. Plus, in addition to the proscuitto, a dry cured Italian ham, the salt overpowered both of our palates by the second slice! The plus side: I enjoyed their crisper thin crust (Famoso keeps getting soggier by the visit for some reason).\n\nSharon ordered the spaghetti frutti mare, a dish with mussels, shrimp, pesto wine sauce, parmesan, and parsley. Beautiful presentation, although you could see the parmesan heavily sprinkled over top. It would have been nice to add that ourselves. Not only was it parmesan on top, it was mixed in with more salt! The whole purpose of boiling pasta with salted water is so that the pasta absorbs the salt, making it tastier, without that salty exterior. The pesto wine sauce was flavorful though but the whole dish was salt salt salt. Perhaps the chef that night had a cold?\n\nNot terribly satisfied with my shared meal, I wanted to try the dessert. How can you go wrong with ordering tiramisu at a restaurant of the same name? What came out was a glass portion of tiramisu. I was expecting an actual slice of tiramisu, and somehow this dish didn't impress me either with its overly soggy ladyfingers (I'm aware they're suppose to be softer, after soaking in coffee, but not to the point of mushy).\n\nOverall, our dinner had multiple areas which needed improvement, although overly seasoned would be one of them. Sharon even commented on how much water she drank throughout the dinner and at home after she dropped me off. Likewise, I was just as thirsty. The bright side to our evening, we finally managed to visit the caf\u00e9, it had a beautiful interior and would be a great place for a coffee or \"lift me up\" snack. There's even a small room for children to play in, an easy drop off while you meet with somebody. The service was excellent with our server being very attentive, especially to our emptying glasses of water. Other tables thanked him for his menu recommendations and the speediness of the kitchen. Would I come back? Maybe on a Friday or Saturday night to try the dinner again. Over seasoning can be easily fixed and it might have been an off night. Definitely for lunch or coffee if Duchess Bakery down the block is filled up to capacity.","date":1361557455000}

To start they tried to charge an extra $200 onto the rooms we had booked about a month ago, (tried to pay for then, but we're told to wait upon arrival) and price guaranteed. After being just plain insulted by 2 people at the front desk, and 40 minutes later they finally agreed to charge the set price. Then we come to find out they ignored our early check-in request (set a week in advance) for one of our two rooms... not a big deal but wait for the big picture. And they also ignored our request for conjoining rooms, again... big picture... finally get both of the rooms and come to realize one is a conjoining room to the room next to it, which is empty the entire stay. Second day we were going to the pool and asked a housekeeper what floor to go to and was told \"figure it the f**k out\" and had the door slammed in my face. Went to the lobby and overheard the manager yelling at a guest who was trying to ask an address of a certain place \"just come here already. Here. Come here.\" Come back to the rooms one rooms ac went out. Stayed out until the next NIGHT. So from Monday 2pm to about Wednesday 6pm. No reason, just ignored our requests. Then we found the wallpaper had started to peel in the corner and the wall was just covered in mold. Called the front desk, were never called back nor had anyone sent up. Called back twice and nothing was done. We go to check out and the GM happened to be there and we kindly talked about everything and that we were very unhappy. As a manager ourself not looking for our money back or anything just hoping they would fix their problems, and we're told we'd be given one nights stay back. GM gets pulled into a meeting says to check with Genesis at the front desk who proceeded to argue about giving our money back. After about 40 minutes just left. So NOTHING about our stay was correct or even enjoyable. I WILL be back to NOLA but there is NO WAY we'd ever stay at this hotel ever again.","date":1528940207000}

We stopped in at the Oldsmar (Tampa Rd.) location last night, and were given the cold shoulder.  The bartender, not only ignored us, but immediately greeted and handed a beer to new-comer at the bar before even making eye contact with us.  So when he finally did acknowledge us, we just told him he was inattentive and we left.  About 10 minutes later, we landed at this location in Palm Harbor.  These people were on the ball.  They greeted us, took our order and had the food out in the time it took just to get a \"how are you?\" from the Oldsmar location.  Totally different experience!  In fact, we told the bartender about what happened in Oldsmar, and her and the manager offered us a free desert for the trouble.  We kindly declined the offer, but the gesture was awesome.  Hands down, the best Applebee's experience on record for us, and we eat at them all the time.\n\nBonus customer delight was that each eating area, even at the bar, has a point of sale terminal where you can visually see your order, pay and tip right on the screen.

But I'm stingy with my stars, and there's one factor that keeps me from giving them that 5th star. \nHere's what I like:\nGreat pulled pork. The sandwich is piled high, moist, and delicious.\nGreat ribs. I'm a NC\/TN boy and these ribs are done just right IMO, especially the dry ribs. The bones fall right out just like they should, and there's those great smoky tough bits on the edges along with the moist and tender meat (drooling just writing this). \nGreat sweet tea. Authentically southern sweet tea - diabetes in a Styrofoam cup.\nGreat condiments. I love the pickles and the pepperocini. In fact, I can't find pepperocini that good anywhere else around here. \nGreat staff. Very friendly and eager to please. C'mon folks, if you've got a problem with something here, just talk to these guys. They'll make it right. \nGreat ambience\/interior. Brings me back to my southern roots just stepping inside. Nice rough-cut  furniture. Lovely smoky smells. You can see straight into the kitchen and watch them at work. They've got a nice smoker and you can tell they care about what they're doing. These guys are the real deal.\nDecent prices. For the food they're putting out there, I think their prices are quite reasonable. BBQ is always a bit steep for my tight budget, but this place makes it doable now and again. \n\nSo my one minor complaint? The sauce. It's good, but it's not stellar. And the sauce at a bbq joint is pretty darn important. I think it just needs some more spice and tang and maybe less tomato paste. But that's just my opinion, and everyone has his own thoughts on what a bbq sauce should taste like. \n\nOverall this is an awesome place and I'm sure I will be back whenever I can afford it or just can't resist the craving any longer. I'll update this sometime when I get a chance to try their wings.","date":1280673851000}

Absolutely everyone working was extremely friendly and happy that we were there. My sons, aged 6,4 & 1 1\/2 are usually well behaved, but the youngest does not like it when mommy leaves the table. She had to take the middle one to the restroom, and mini-me lost it. A guy out of the back named Byron came and talked him out of his tantrum in about 10 seconds. Instantly loved Byron. Another one of the waiting staff came over with crayons (something I doubt they usually need because I got the feeling they don't have many young families come in) and let the kids draw on the table covering. The owner(?) came over and joked around with the kids at one point after I ordered, and this personal connection continued through the whole experience. \n\nOh yeah, by the way, we also ate!\n\nWe had the Bhindi, the Dal Makhani, Butter Chicken (of course), and Tandoori Shrimp. \n\nI usually prefer my Bhindi Bhaji to be a bit more salty and crisper, but the texture and flavour were amazing. Even better than my favourite Indian place back home (Sorry, New Asian Village). The Dal was exactly as it should be, warm and wholesome. The butter chicken was full of flavour and not bland and dry like most Indian places. And the Tandoori Shrimp was excellent, served on a bed of veggies, sliced up and sizzling like fajitas on a skillet plate. \n\nThe naan was tasty, not oily, and just the right thickness for spooning the food. Basmati rice served to soak up the sauces perfectly.\n\nAfter dinner, the owner covertly asked if it was okay for the kids to have a chocolate bar. We agreed, and he surprised them with a Kitkat (I lost the rock, paper, scissors to my wife for the last stick), and Byron came out again to talk a bit about life, love, and the world around us! After finding out we were from Canada, he made sure we knew about all the great restaurants in the area, told us we HAD to go to the zoo and aquarium, and agreed with me and regaled us with example after example when I told him I thought New Orleans was better than it ever was pre-Katrina. \n\nMy oldest son turned to me as we walked out the door, \"That's the greatest restaurant I've ever been to, daddy!\" \n\nHe's six, and prone to a six year old's hyperbole, but I just replied, \"You might be right, buddy.\"","date":1381551708000}

Friends come over on Friday night 9\/19\/14 and decide they are hungry. Knowing bareburger is new in the area I take this as a perfect opportunity to try it. I walk in at 10:40pm and no host at the stand. He is wiping tables and says to me \"sorry sir, but takeout only now.\" I was okay with that. I was going to make a six person order and take it back to my apt.... Only, when I get to the counter, 3 people leaning behind the counter look at me confused. When I say I'd like to make a takeout order, the guy says the kitchen is closed. I look at my watch and at the three booths that still have people eating.... And back at him. He musters out a \"sorry.\" \nI then turned to leave and when I got half way to the door he said \"sir, would you like to take a menu so that you can see what we have and come back later?\" Really dude? No! What I'd like is to order actual food for the 5 hungry people at my apt from the restaurant I specifically came to try at 10:40 on a weekend night in center city.  \nI'd like to comment on the food, but I wasn't able to try it. Then I was met with bad customer service on top of it.\nNeedless to say I won't be coming back to try the food. I took myself and my money out of the front door of bareburger and went to one of the many other places on walnut that weren't seemingly perturbed to see a customer walk into their establishment.

I have no idea. It is something I will never understand because it's not like red peppers are more expensive and it seems unlikely that they would mix up the word yellow and the word red. Perhaps the guy who makes the sandwiches is red\/yellow colorblind. It's a mystery.

We have been wanting to try Osteria for a while now because we love the other Vetri restaurants and we love Alla Spina. The space is very nice and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The service was attentive but not overly so. We started off with appetizers and went with the sweetbreads and the octopus salad. The salad was quite good and the char on the octopus was just enough to give it that charcoal taste while still keeping the octopus nice and tender, the arugula went well with it and it was a good portion. The sweetbreads came with fruit that was either sauteed or braised in a simple syrup. The sweetbreads were wonderfully cooked and went extremely well with the fruit. For our entrees we went with the asparagus pasta and the suckling pork special. The pasta was awesome, definitely made fresh and it tasted as though they cooked the pasta in maybe some vegetable or some chicken stock which gave it another added layer of flavor. The suckling pig was amazing, I need to get some pork and brine it for 4 days like they do with theirs. It takes the flavors to another level, they give you a little of everything and I wish that I would have ordered it twice. I wanted to try their polenta but forgot to put in an order so I will next time. We ended the meal with the chocolate flan which is really like a chocolate lava cake and the hazelnut crostata. Both were good but not really memorable to be honest and that's why I removed 1 star. There were other things on the dessert menu that I wanted to try and maybe I just didn't choose well, it might just be me. Anyways I would say a solid dinner and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice place to go out or to take friends. We will definitely be returning in the future.","date":1404821417000}

My head is still spinning so let me just start with some descriptive words like fabulous, amazing, genius, innovative, collective, and dare I say it, a Reno stroke of brilliance? \nMeticulously planned from the dirt to the artistically placed metal beams these three co-owners deserve all Reno can serve up! I think the only way to do justice to this soon-to-be Reno hot spot is to run through it point by point.\n\n1. The Building: This one time liquor distribution building with wonderful architecture sat vacant, went through a fire and found new love with the creation of the Depot. Attached conveniently is their own 60 spot parking lot making getting in and out a breeze. The biggest walk-in I have ever seen.  A gorgeous state of the art brewery\/whiskey distillery which is all run via state of the art technology by Brew Master Brandon Wright. People that's just the outside!\n\n2. So...Let's Go In Shall We? This is what I'm going to describe as California deli meets high end New York bistro minus the snobbery. From the neutral tones to the buildings bones everything about its interior says come in have a drink, eat, talk politics, religion, or how you did your kids hair, no one will judge and no one will care - all are welcome at the Depot.  Now you all know I love a restaurant that does what I call triple duty and what I mean by that is, one gets the feeling that you can go in jeans\/shorts, on a date night dressed to the nines for that fancy feel, or simply load up the family and have a great meal. There is something for everyone at the Depot. \n With a bar on each floor there is seating aplenty. Diner-like seating for those of you in a rush, private seating for all your events, patio seating outside diners with soon to come games and music, and table seating with a view. The Depot is contemporary without the fuss.\n\n3. Staff: This one always gets me and often causes me to take a few points off my reviews. Well, not here - these three owners have trained their staff and knowledgafied them (yes I made that word up)  beautifully. Kasey, my server was not only the perfect balance of attentive with out being intrusive, she was friendly, offering up suggestions, knowledge of drinks\/menu items and unknown facts and history of the restaurant. Throughout, I was unable to walk past any staff member who didn't ask if I needed anything or offer to help. Well done staff you've got my vote.\n\n4. Now the Reason We All Are Here The FOOD:  Here is where all restaurants need to shine. So did the Depot shine?  YES for the most part it did. I opted for trying a few of their \"Starters\" since it was lunch time and I was unable to choose just one from this culinary intriguing menu.\n First up was a Curry Cauliflower soup served in a small brass handled pot. Creamy and rich, blended just right with a delicately placed amount of spice. It did however come lukewarm, a minor stumble which was promptly corrected (a small oversight as they haven't been open a week).\n Next up was a house made Apple Chicken Sausage served with provolone cheese and apple chutney or so the menu says. It actually arrived to the table on a brioche bun with caramelized onions, NO provolone cheese, NO apple chutney but instead a fab house made ketchup. When I broke the dish down (deconstructed it for all you foodies) each component stood on its own. The bun was great but a tad large for the meat to bread ratio, the chicken sausage had that classic snap but a little bland for my taste.  I really want to know I'm eating a sausage. Now the caramelized onions -  I haven't a clue and neither would it seem does the menu.    \n Moving along... Duck Confit Sliders served Bahn mi style with pickled carrots, cilantro and a jalapeno mayo. Three to a plate these little beauties arrived and I must admit I had a slight gleam in my eye. These things are pretty impressive.  I loved the balance of the light BBQ-like sauce against the tang from the pickled carrots. I even giggled a little bit when taking my first bite of this slider served on a brioche bun. Why you might be asking? Ok I will tell you. Bahn mi is a Vietnamese term for all kinds of bread but more specifically the baguette which was introduced by the French during its colonial period -  brioche-baguette, you get the point. \n As so many good things must and often do, my lunch has come to an end but never fear, this will not be my last meal at the Depot.  As I lovingly sip from a glass designed to be the perfect IPA vessel for my masterfully crafted IPA that I'm so very much enjoying, I reflect on what just happened here.  The menu is intriguing, engaging, and well designed. I have a smile as I anticipate the future excitement of working my way through the entire menu. The feel of this place is unlike anything Reno has seen. The Depot has artfully and thoughtfully and quite frankly brought food back to what it was meant to be... an event... and a delightful journey for all the senses. It's about time.","date":1420675235000}

Their happy hour menu is decent sized, you can get a variety of drinks and food for a lot cheaper than the usual menu price.\n\nI got 3 things at Distrito- red wine Sangria, fried fish taco, and a chicken taco.\n\nThe red wine sangria was decently strong and pretty cheap. They had cut-up fruit in the glass, but they didn't seem to add any flavor at all and were actually annoying to avoid while drinking! But then again, it was only like $4, so there are no complaints there.\n\nThe fish taco was EASILY one of the best tacos I've ever had in my life. There was a slice of avacado, some pickled veggies and a piece of fried fish in the center. I can't place my finger on what made it so delicious, but it was fantastic. \n\nMy mistake was eating the chicken taco AFTER the fish taco. To be fair, the chicken taco was great and pretty flavorful, but my taste buds weren't satisfied with the chicken taco right after experiencing the greatness that was the fish taco. The chicken was moist and flavorful, but it just wasn't fish.\n\nOverall, I'd say my experience here was great. The bartender was very alert and attentive, the happy hour selection was good, and the tacos were delicious. The downside is that everything else that's not on the Happy Hour menu is pretty expensive, and that Happy Hour only took place at the bar, which had limited seating. Otherwise, I'd come here more often!\n\nTo me, the sangria was a 4, the fish taco was easily a 5, and the chicken taco was a 4. That being said, I'd only come back for Happy Hour, as the rest of the menu was very pricey for bar\/Mexican food.","date":1415311391000}

It is on the sweet side, so if you're sensitive to that, ask for it on the side.

It is a necessary, upscale addition to the Mass Ave scene.  Defiantly NOT a pub, but also not as pretentious as they have every right to be.

A well edited seasonal selection of local brews make it the perfect spot even if your not in a cocktail mode.  It's the perfect spot for pre or post dinner drinks, a light dinner itself before a show at the Murat\/Old National Centre or to begin or end a night on the town.  The vibe is intimate, but not awkward -- so while it's great with your significant other or close friends -- it's just as great for business &  work outings and shows out of towners the amazing food & drink scene Indy has.\n\nOn the food front, I appreciate the single selections of a wide variety of cheeses - in which you can make your own amazing cheese plate.  The olives & bar nuts are must orders as soon as you walk in and if you are really hungry -- then order up the mac & cheese or artichoke dip.\n\nThe servers are mostly trendy, artist types and as sweet as can be -- no eye rolls when you ask for a water.

The 24 hour fitness center is also nicer than the one I have in my own town and overlooks the sidewalk, so there's decent people watching while you're on the treadmill.\n\nMy only complaints would be in regard to \"environmental friendliness\" and parking. Although they advertise they're \"environmentally friendly\" and encourage you to reuse your towels and not have your linens changed, they changed mine daily the entire duration I was there despite the fact that I hung up my towels and did not request linen changes. Also, be prepared to sacrifice your first born in order to pay for parking. $22 a day. Sonofagun.","date":1338155887000}

(They open at 9 a.m.)  Since it was sunny and very comfortable outside, we chose to sit on the patio overlooking Mass Avenue.\n\nOur server was very attentive and upbeat throughout our breakfast.  After she brought our beverages, it didn't take long for our meal to be delivered.  Overall service was excellent!\n\nMy wife opted for the Eggs Benedict Sandwich - two slices of thick-cut ham, fried egg, smoked gouda, with a house-made spicy brown mustard on a pretzel bun.  She chose the sweet potato waffle fries with cinnamon butter ($1 upgrade) as her side.  When the waitress set her plate down, we did a double take at the size of the sandwich.  I got to sample a bite of the sandwich and we agree that it was delicious.  The ham was full of flavor and the mustard and pretzel combo really added depth of flavor to the meal (much like it does on the Ralston burger.)  She needed a \"to go\" box for half the sandwich!  She also enjoyed the sweet potato waffle fries.  They normally come with house ketchup, but she opted for the upgrade and was glad she did.  Delicious!\n\nTo go along with my giant cup of coffee, I chose two entrees:  French Toast and Bananas Foster (which comes with two slices of bacon) and my side of mixed fruit; and the Ham and Brie Crepe with a side of yogurt and blueberries.  The French Toast was huge, nearly two inches thick and had a cake like texture inside the crispy exterior.  Cinnamon syrup, powdered sugar, and plenty of bananas covered every bite of the the toast so that each bite gave full flavor.  No alcohol flavor was detectable on this version.  The crepe was light and had folded slices of ham wrapped inside with gooey cheese.  \n\nAll the items we ordered were prepared well.  If there was any negative at all, it was that the bacon was a little bit soggy and cooled, but still delicious.\n\nI hope some friends will read this and want to join us the next time we go out for brunch.  5 stars all the way!\n\nRev #8","date":1470586489000}

I grew up in New Jersey and I feel like this entitles me to a certain amount of snobbery and entitlement to being able to pass judgment on bagels and those who make them. \nWe came here on a Sunday morning and were surprised that it wasn't busier.  The service was decent and we split a bagel veggie breakfast sandwich and a bagel ham & egg sandwich.  Both were great and were a good way to start out the day. I wasn't a fan of the coffee, it just didn't do it for me and I typically like rich coffees. The veggies on the veggie sandwich were really well spiced and are what made the sandwich. I liked how the fritta egg magicalness on both sandwiches were also really good.  \nSo the bagels? This far way from the metro New York area? Good job, these bagels pass muster. They were pretty good - probably not the same as \"back home\" but I was pretty pleased with them overall. \nThe atmosphere of this restaurant was really neat. I really liked the d\u00e9cor and it's a really light, nice place. I kind of wish that I had a paper to curl up to and read for hours.","date":1242590126000}

Both her and our server (Asher) are always welcoming. Friends and I usually sit at the bar, taking shots of Old Grand Dad (or whatever is handy), along with standbys like duck farts and snake bites. Of course, you can't drink on an empty stomach; my favorite dish there is the huge Ulster Fry ($10.95; the Irish Breakfast; Eireannach Bricfeasta), consisting of two eggs, black and white pudding, roasted tomatoes (delicious!), bangers, rashers and beans.\n\nThe Shanachie takes me to my happy place, and is worth checking out!","date":1211580901000}

I got the hangover sandwich and it was ok, nothing mind blowing especially for the price. I wanted to like this place so badly, because of the farm to table concept, So I decided to go back for dinner. Went back for dinner and had a better experience. The Rockefeller oysters were amazing and the truffle Parmesan fries were perfectly crisp and not overly soggy and oily. I ordered the sweet potato gnocchi and basically licked my plate clean of all the sauce. It was delicious! I love sweet potato, so this dish was perfect for me. \n\nI went back this past Friday  with my boyfriend and 2 other friends and I had a mediocre experience. The swine flatbread was light and great appetizer that was tasty but not too heavy. I also ordered the shrimp and grits. The dish was almost cold when I received it, I did not want to send it back as I feared heating it more would overcook the shrimp. That being said, the last time I had shrimp and grits at Roux, they were bursting with flavor and this dish was not. My boyfriend ordered the short rib dish and it was very disappointing. We had looked  at Yelp pics and saw this dish in a photo and when the dish arrived, we were disappointed that the pasta was plain crinkly style pasta instead of large ravioli style pasta. The dish description said there was spinach but there was barely a hint. The goat cheese helped a lil with flavor but it needed a dap more to spread all throughout the dish. The short rib was sooo bland. That being said when we reheated our leftovers the next day we added  some spice and seasoning and the dish was so much tastier.  My friends ordered the tuna appetizer and the staff chicken meal with fried green tomatoes. Chicken was very simple, but the green tomatoes were to die for. I have tried the fried green tomato app and I would recommend that. We ordered desert and opted  for coffee and the bread pudding. I know coffee isn't a speciality here but my boyfriend and I always get coffee with dessert at restaurants. Both were terrible. I had to send these back, this time. The blueberry banana bread pudding was more of a cornbread in a skillet. It was very dry and not how i was accustomed to eating banana bread pudding desserts. The ice cream however was good. The coffee tasted like bad office coffee. Tasted old and watery, and not hot at all! The server offered to remove both items. The service was ok as well. It seems that At Boca you have to be sure to order the right things and just go on a good day. There isn't consistency.","date":1474235264000}

Broken into sections that help you decide on what kind of protein, what style of food, it might take a few minutes to decide what to order!  Meat - sure! Vegetarian? You bet. Gluten free? OF COURSE! \n\nAs with Indian food, it's great to bring friends so you can all share and sample a number of dishes.  I'm not a curry person...so, I don't usually order it.  Another interesting factoid - it's family run and called Fusion because the owners happen to be Fijian and Indian, so the dishes are as diverse as the owners, and sometimes they just cross over for fantastic Fusion.\n\nPretty much anything on the menu (except the naan bread) is gluten free! No, they fry nothing, so no pakoras...sorry.  My other half ordered naan bread and chose plain but garlic is also available.\n\nI can most definitely vouch for the Matar Paneer... I could NOT stop eating it at a prior visit.  I think I deprived the person who had ordered it of their share!! This visit, with such a diverse menu, I had to try something different...so we ordered the butter chicken, saffron rice, and aloo gobi. We were SO full. There was enough food for two with leftovers we were delighted to have had for lunch the next day!\n\nFood is made when you order, it's not a meal you rush.  Take out and delivery is available.  Perfect for a picnic in the park if you happen to be wandering down to the River Valley.\n\nThe flavour of the butter chicken was wonderful - so much meat and just the right amount of spicy! Despite the name, no dairy was harmed in the making of the dish.  The aloo gobi is a wonderfully spiced flavourful cauliflower and potato dish. There is some kick in both of them, but both dishes are incredibly flavourful, the spice doesn't overpower the dish.  With a bit of  heat, don't forget to order yourself a lassi before you get your meal! I am not a fan of mangoes, unless they come in lassi form! It disappeared faster than my supper!\n\nThe beautiful copper water pitcher and glasses kept the water soooo chilly.  Most welcome on a hot summer afternoon.\n\nThe decor, is comforting, it isn't overly lit, warm, intimate and lovely. Unique items adorn the walls, from a dried? crocodile to plants and feathers, with cushions in the corner seats, and a long table in the back next to the bar for a happy gathering of friends or family.  Noise, I've never noticed more than the murmur of great conversations being had.\n\nA lovely little patio out front, in the shade in the afternoon, but if you prefer air conditioning, there's about 40 seats inside.  Convenient parking in a private paved lot right out front.\n\nOh, and I didn't realize they were open late on weekends, however, I suspect that if customer traffic is slow, they may close up a little early. These folks really hustle, and I can't be upset.\n\n\nThis restaurant has the kindest owners.  For years they have had a sign on the side service entrance for folks who cannot afford to buy a meal, they could knock and food would be shared. This kind of community spirit is impressive. They feed up to 20 folks a day. A DAY. Truly gems of our city.","date":1504857976000}

You've got Citizen's Bank Park which is the home of the Philadelphia Phillies, then there's the Wells Fargo Center which is the home of the 76'ers and the Flyers, and then the Lincoln Financial Center which is the home of the Eagles. In between these three stadiums sits XFINITY Live! which was built at the site of the old Philadelphia Spectrum, and is now home to the world's largest sports bar.\n\nXFINITY is massive in scale with both indoor and outdoor eating, drinking, and partying facilities and can easily hold thousands of people. The facility houses The Philly MarketPlace, Spectrum Grill, Broad Street Bullies Pub, PBR Bar and Grill, Victory Beer Hall and the NBC Sports Arena -- all under one roof. Each of these bars and restaurants would make for an impressive sports bar, but when you put them all together, it is mind-boggling. Inside the PBR Bar sits a mechanical bull which is apprently quite popular after a few Jager shots.\n\nThe whole place is decorated with hardwood flooring from the Spectrum, as well as the \"boards and glass\" from the hockey arena, and bricks from the old Veteran's Stadium. They have indoor and outdoor events, viewing parties, concerts, tailgating parties, and so on.\n\nThrough a partnership with Sony, XFINITY Live! Philadelphia was built with state-of-the-art audio and video systems, including Sony flat panel televisions, to ensure everyone in the venue has a high definition view of the game. The NBC Sports Arena offers fans a one-of-a-kind sports viewing experience, featuring a 32-foot diagonal, 6mm, LED HD television, high impact LED Rings displaying the NBC Sports Ticker, and in-game promotions. This place has a serious WOW factor, and it needs to be on the bucket list of any true sports fan.\n\nTravis, my man, I'm thinking road trip.......","date":1359073118000}

Oooo they have made a meatball lover out of me! So very good, there is like a tender, melt in your mouth quality to their meatballs that I really enjoy. The cheese is top notch quality packs a lot of flavor and the sauce I can't recall anything particularly special but it was good also. \n\nI'd later return and get the same sandwich in the traditional version. I want to branch out and try more, specifically I'd like to try the morse of three for 9 but that only includes ball and sauce, so I see that getting pricey.\n\nAnd speaking of pricey, that they are, I agree with those that said it's worth it, but also feel they'll do great business if they throw some specials in the mix, and make the prices a flat rate rather you choose a sauce or a topping. \n\nI think there was a bit of confusion the day I went also,I was charged an extra 50 cents because under the ala carte menu, you'd get what I got with a topping, not a sauce so they charged me for a sauce. When I caught it I told them it looks like, from reading the menu there are Ala carte choices and under Nonni's sandwiches, a get what is listed here for the price listed here option. They told me there were some corrections that need to be made to the menu so for the classic that was correct because I got a sauce not a topping (you'd have to see the menu for this to  make more sense) Two things should have happened, they should have just honored the price on the menu, and should have told me of the extra charge being there was nothing in reading the menu that would have me to think I should have been charged extra....or a third thing could have happened, telling me in advance there was an issue with pricing on the menu.\n\nNot holding that against them in this review however and believe it may have been a we just opened so we don't know what we're doing error, because the menu hasn't changed and it's now available online with the exact same info, so perhaps the women on the register that day just got it wrong.\n\nIn short (after a long review hee hee) I'd go again but they'll need to get some lower cost options going for me to be a regular and oh the smashed idea isn't working too well IMO, you get two balls one on each half basically and the idea is to smash it and it'll spread across the bread....yeah not so much......still very yummy however but for the price that needs to be worked out a little better.","date":1293719007000}

I constantly see delicious food pictures and rave reviews for this place all over Instagram. This Friday, my husband and I finally decided to visit this hotspot. We tried to arrive as early as we could, as we knew that the place would be packed. \n\nWhen we arrived at about 6pm, there were a few people in front of us and everyone was seated right away. This seemed to remain consistent throughout the night, always a small lineup but it didn't seem like people were waiting long to be seated. Unfortunately when we arrived there were no more two person tables left, so we had to share a table with another group. Not a big deal, but it's not my favorite when visiting a restaurant with my husband.\n\nOur server greeted us within a few minutes and took our order (we came prepared). The food came out quickly in about 15 minutes. My husband and I ordered a lot of food to share: \n\nDorinku Appetizer Platter\nShaka Shaka Fries\nPressed Wild Saba Sushi \nNegi Miso Duck \n & some deep fried chicken topped with their house made hot sauce. \n\nThe Appetizer Platter was absolutely delicious. It's an assortment of starters including the Tuna Tataki, Tomato Kimchi and Beef Tataki. All were absolutely delicious, my new favorite is the Tomato Kimchi. We also tried the Shaka Shaka Fries as so many people are raving about it online. They shake the fries in a brown paper bag at your table with seasoning. It's super good but I actually found the seasoning to be too sweet. This would be good to share if you had more than 2 people at your table. \n\nThe sushi was good but it didn't amaze me. In all honesty, I can't really remember what it tastes like. \n\nThe Negri Miso Duck was also delicious but I found it to be a tad bit overcooked (a little bit dry). My husband also really loved the spicy chicken, but I found the sauce to resemble Frank's too much. \n\nOverall I enjoyed the starters the best. I think if I were to come back, it would be during lunch. Their lunch sets look really good and are overall a better value.","date":1536719292000}

Due to this event, I was happy to try the sandwich that bested Bobby Flay.\n\nFor $5.49, you'll receive one quarter of a muffaletta. This sounds little, but it's as large as most full sandwiches and filled me up pretty well.  In it contains fresh ham, thick cut genoa salami, swiss & provolone cheese, and a homemade olive salad, all in between two seeded loaves of Italian bread.  I commend them for not using any sauces, but as a consequence, the sandwich was dry and the bread was difficult to chew.  Overall, the muffaletta is respectable tasting because the olive salad exhibited bold, zingy, and refreshing flavors, but the dryness is hard to override--even with great tasting meats.\n----\nConclusion: Inside this establishment, it seems like a half deli\/half bar with TV's and jerseys on the walls. (Supposedly Peyton Manning is a fan of Serio's) To think this muffaletta destroyed Bobby Flay made me question Bobby Flay's skills altogether since I thought it was just average in taste.  Regardless, if in wanting of a muffaletta, hail a taxi to Butcher Cuchon instead to find the best one ever created.  \n\nExtra Notes:\n-Accepts credit card\n-Check in on Yelp to receive a free drink with sandwich purchase!\n-Fantastic customer service, friendly people\n-Decor seems old and worn down projecting a sad and crabby atmosphere; the menu needs to be revised to look cleaner too\n-Restroom Available","date":1429162562000}

Most of the mountain is public land, the Mt. Lemmon National Forest.  Anything they make and the workers they employ must be transported up that mountain, as the only private homes are in nearby Summerhaven.  Houses in Summerhaven are very expensive, so not too many restaurant workers can afford them.  \n\nBecause of this, there is a dollar premium paid.  More expensive to run the restaurant means more expensive food.  Also, let's face it, they're nearly the only game in town.  Without them, you're buying hot dogs at the Summerhaven Mini Mart\/Post Office for $5 each.\n\nAtmosphere is very ski-lodge rustic, with some great views of the mountain valley and outdoor seating to boot.  We were up there after ski season, so it was really not crowded. \n\nService - my, that cashier is legendary for her sourness, isn't she?  She glared at us too.  Really.\n\nOnce we were seated, the service was outstanding, and yes, the chili and cornbread are not to be missed.  Very, very good.  The hamburger was fine, nothing earth shattering.  The cobbler is deadly good too.\n\nOne star off for Ms. Sourpuss.  Otherwise, I'd recommend stopping in when you're up on top of the mountain.","date":1330029981000}

Cafe Kili has been right under my nose for quite some time, I must have been to to Applebees and Tokyo Sushi a million times and never noticed that there was a nice place right next door. I decided to come here after reading Sally L.'s review and must say she did a pretty great job on her review.\n\nThe people who work there are extremely friendly. The minute I walked in and approached the counter the man at the register was friendly and helpful. I let him know it was my first time and he recommended the soup of the day, Shrimp Corn Bisque to me, along with a chilled Caramel Latte for this hot weather we're having today in sunny Tampa, Florida.\n\nThe Caramel Latte was excellent sweet with a good coffee taste, as Sally mentions the taste isn't overly powerful, but just right for people who prefer not to have that Cuban coffee taste. It was way better than any Starbucks coffee I have had...maybe I have been spending too much money there.\n\nThe Shrimp Corn Bisque was a bit of a shot in the dark for me because I didn't know whether I was going to really like it or not, but this soup tastes amazing. A nice sweet taste, the shrimp tastes really fresh and the corn tastes fantastic as well. I'm a little sad that I only got a cup, if it is here the next time I come I will have a bowl for sure.\n\nThe place also has free-wifi which is always a nice plus and when I sat down I found a power charger with plenty of plug slots to ensure that even groups will have enough plugs to charge their laptops or whatever devices they bring.\n\nThe ambiance of the place is quite relaxing. Today the clientele seems to be an older crowd and I could really see myself studying here sometime. It could be because it's summer that there doesn't seem to be many USF students around. \n\nThe cafe is decorated with pictures and decorations to give it that African vibe with Zebra statues nearby, African gifts and jewelery for sale, and a painting of some animals in Africa up on the walls nearby me. Even the outside of the bathroom has an African illustration on it.

We tried the provolone cheese, pork, and spinach (maybe broccoli rabe?) pizza that was a twist on the roast pork sandwiches. It was good! But again, the saltiness killed me. What also put a damper on our night was the front area where you can sit and eat your slices. It was small and the door was constantly opening and slamming shut from the delivery peeps so it was kind of a sucky ambience which is to be expected I think of most pizza places. Still.

Central European food has never been in my top 5 cuisines. There are certain exceptions to that, like sausage and dumplings. Hello, Brauhaus Schmitz!\n\nThey got what you need - pretty much all of their sausages are in the good to great scale, and their sides are also pretty great. Shoot, you could go for the sides alone - at 3 bucks for a small or 6 for a large, they're kind of perfect as bar snacks. Again, dumplings! They're kind of like giant gnocchi covered in butter and herbs. Who wouldn't want that? Probably people who suck. I don't want them in my spots anyway.\n\nThe real reason you'd be here, though, is the beer. They have a huge selection of stuff you won't really find elsewhere in the city because it's pretty much all actually from Germany, and a lot of it is small batch stuff. Their prices don't really give you a discount for ordering a full liter - aside from the cool factor of having a giant stein in your hand - so you can rest easy and order pints to get more variety in. The bartenders know their stuff, and make awesome suggestions if you can tell them what you want in your drink besides \"help me forget about the carrot thing.\"\n\nAlso, they serve flights on old-timey wooden skis.

Their buffet is always well stocked, and though usually crowded, I have never had to wait in line for my food. The lack of a line or obstacles between me and the food, however, usually means that I leave there needing to be rolled out the door. Sitar has the usual array of vegetarian and meat dishes found at Nashville Indian restaurants, all well cooked and well seasoned. Weirdly enough the Naan bread is hands down my favorite part of the meal, as I have never found better Naan bread anywhere and fear that I never will. My one complaint is that my favorite dish, Chicken Tikka Massala, which was served during the buffet when I first moved to Nashville is for some reason no longer there. I don't know if I'm just coming on the wrong days, but it breaks my heart.

Attached to the St. Louis Blues Museum, Sugarfire unites two St. Louis icons BBQ and the blues.\n\n  Furthermore, a BBQ fan would be at home in this St. Louis institution in the shadow of the Blues Museum. As a matter of fact when this BBQ fan asked the Lyft driver restaurant recommendations on the ride from the airport to downtown, she recommended Sugarfire. Consequently, so did Yelp with a high cumulative rating. Haplessly the building on the other side of the adjacent Blues Museum was Embassy Suites where we were staying.\n\n After checking into the hotel on a Friday afternoon when we were looking for that special place to serve our leading St. Louis dinner, we walked to Sugarfire. Apparently so did hundreds of other BBQ fans. Like a Muddy Waters concert in his prime there was a long line inside. We chose to delay it for later in the week.\n\n  On a weekday afternoon, it was far less busy. Right away an enthusiastic employee greeted us. He was enthusiastically telling my brother about their sugar cane cola. I was enthusiastically deciding what to order. When it comes to ordering, it is critical to mention that this is a cafeteria style restaurant. It works like this, the customer orders off a handwritten menu or the menu overhead before pointing to the employee what you want on your plate. In assembly line fashion you proceed past the presentation of food including side dishes and other items. In this process the meat that you ordered will be placed on the tray. It is my understanding that there is complimentary pickles. Then at the end of the assembly line analogous to the food presentation cases the customer pays. From there the process continues to the self serve sugar cane beverage fountain. Nearby is the sauce station that holds the unique sauces including 47 and coffee. On a busy day where the line reaches out to Washington Avenue, it will obviously be a challenge finding a table. After seeing a lot of downtown St. Louis, my advice when it is filled up is to take the food to go and have a Smoke fire BBQ style picnic in Kiener  or Old Post Office Plaza.\n\n  Fortunately, there were a sundry of tables on our visit. From the table, I took in an inviting dining environment that celebrated the blues. Blues and BBQ put me in a St. Louis state of mind. If I wasn't in a St. Louis state of mind already, there above the tables the Cardinals were on TV. When I walked to the restroom, I saw the Blues Museum. When I walked to the vestibule, I saw the bull and cattle statues that from my understanding are smokers.\n\n More critical to the sights around me was the sight below me. That was my food. I ordered the two meat combination with two sides plus a fountain sugar cane beverage. The two meats were smoked brisket and ribs. The two sides were cheesy potatoes and jamboree rice. As, I stated before this is a cafeteria style restaurant. With that said: \"In my opinion the food was \"Good\" yet \"Nothing Exceptional.\"\" The reality is that I liked the two sides as much as the smoked meat. By the way, I really liked the cream flavor of the sugar cane soda. \n\n  My thinking would be full of muddy water, if I were to go on here alleging that my opinion is the ultimate one. I am just one person who from personal experience is reviewing a cafeteria style BBQ restaurant to full service BBQ restaurants in the likes of the Galleria Mall Weber Grill and Fox's BBQ in Boulder City that have served me BBQ cuisine that is out of this world delicious. The reality is that despite my opinion, Sugarfire is a St. Louis BBQ icon that consistently brings in lines of people with plenty of accolades. Furthermore the reality is that there is nothing wrong with a good BBQ restaurant that is easy on the wallet with most meals and beverage in an upbeat environment costing less than $20. If you happen to be in downtown St. Louis when Sugarfire is uncrowded, I recommend stepping inside where BBQ and the Blues will lead you into a St. Louis state of mind.","date":1538098925000}

If I lived in this stunning food city I would eat here at least once a week. We started off with some drinks. The Practical Magic was pretty good but pales in comparison to the Northern Lights. Not only does it look beautiful but the taste is phenomenal. I also got the Tahitian Mint Tea (hot). It comes in a French press and was a very tasty accompaniment to the meal.  The hummus is such a fantastic starter because it is so easily shareable with your party. Ripping off pieces of the piping hot pita and scooping up some hummus is such a communal experience at the table. We got the fried chicken and cauliflower and both were fantastic. We also got the Crispy Haloumi to share which was a nice balance of sweet and salty. For large plates we got the Slow-Cooked Lamb, Hanger Steak, and Kvaroy Salmon. Our table agreed all three were delicious but our favorite was the steak. The lamb is delicious by itself but with the feta and tabouleh it really brings it all together. The salmon is cooked well and the couscous is really tasty as well. For dessert we got the Warm Chocolate Babka, which was unbelievable and the Ashta Knafeh which was good if it's what you like but I would have liked it a little sweeter. All in all a truly fantastic meal and a must get.","date":1640810145000}

Other than being on the premises a few times over the years, I knew of the Tucson National as the place my parents held their wedding reception back in 1988. I turned out to have a fantastic five night stay. There's a lot to unpack here, so I'm going to get started all while my suitcase will sit in the corner of my bedroom nearly untouched for the next week.\n\nLet's start with the overall location and common areas. The homes right next to the resort, as well as all the grounds and buildings are a sight for sore eyes let me tell you; the property is an absolute beaut. It's one of the only local resorts that don't heavily play up the rustic, desert theme. As an AZ native, the rustic AZ stuff starts to feel cliche after awhile. There are a few cacti and native plants around , Mexican tile in the restrooms, and an awesome mountain view to remind you that you're in Tucson, but it's mostly palm trees, flowers and grass outside the Spanish-style buildings. I did not get to try the pool or spa services but it all looked very nice. The lobby was probably last remodeled in the early 90s like others have complained about ad nauseum, but the marble floors, dramatic staircase, plants, and very cool detailing made up for that. Plus, despite the age, nothing was rundown or in disrepair in that area. \n\nI really liked the staff, which is atypical as that is in area in which I usually find fault in these resort hotels. They were friendly as can be--even the guard gate operators. They are  responsive too--there was a fire department Christmas party one night, where several got drunk and thought it would be a good idea to strip into their underpants at 11 pm and dive into the pool in 43 degree weather. Security was on it promptly, and nipped that in the bud before it got out of hand.\n\nNow on to the room--I was EXTREMELY impressed with the size and features for the price. It was right on the golf course, and offered a great view of that, as well as the Santa Catalina Mountans. The rooms have definitely been touched renovation-wise within the last decade, and everything was in great shape; I encountered none of the severe maintenance problems that others did, but those seem to be isolated to the casita rooms which indeed have not had any meaningful update since the 90s, and are not being rented out at this time. There is storage galore in these rooms: tons of drawers, and a very large (for a standard hotel room), walk-in closet. Most of the lights had dimmer switches, and the room has plenty of places to sit: a sofa, and two club chairs in addition to the desk chair, and beds. The television was just the right size for adequate viewing from anywhere. The bathroom was really nice too. The beds succeeded at being everything to everyone. The beds had just the right amount of firmness and softness with a nice, springy feel. \n\nAs for COVID protocols, they had the usual room service menu that has to be accessed with a QR code, and they were a bit skimpy on bath products, towels, writing utensils, and coffee\/tea; being the second time I've stayed in a hotel since COVID hit the fan, this has become the norm. We did ask for more, and they delivered. They had stickers on the hotel lobby entry door that they're AZ clean certified and not to enter if you feel ill, and tons of hand sanitizer, but mask usage throughout the property was next to non-existent. Because I believe opinions on COVID protocols tend to be politically-driven, I am declining to state my opinion, and instead will be giving you, the reader, the opportunity to construct your own opinion on the matter based on the info that I am providing.\n\nAs far as complaints, there are only a few. The first one is about television programming--it isn't fantastic. They have one HBO channel, but no pay-per-view in theater movies, ability to use streaming services, or ability to view the bill, TV listings, or in-room dining menu on the TV--most hotels of this caliber have something like this. The channels seem geared towards news and sports with some channels not having any audio at all. These rooms could also benefit from a mini bar or very small fridge--none of which were present, and that was surprising in an otherwise feature-filled room. \n\nI did not dine at Bob's this trip, or have room service but did dine at Legends, and thfood8i was very good. Refer to that restaurant's page for my review.\n\nTo say that I was bummed to have to go back home is a gross understatement. I could definitely see myself in the future, and I do recommend it to anyone who appreciates a very nice setting.","date":1640126961000}

We sat upstairs which was away from the front door and kitchen. The waitress took our drink orders promptly and then took our food order when she returned. I ordered the Italian omelette. The three egg omelette was filled with mozzarella cheese, bite size pieces of sausage, pepperoni and sauce. The omelette was huge and I savored every bite. I also had wheat toast and a ton of home fries with peppers and onions. The home fries were roasted nicely and the veggies were fresh and cooked perfectly. My coworker ordered a spinach and cheese omelette which looked delicious. My only concern was I felt the chef used too much salt.

The hours are pretty limited so I only just got around to coming here on a Saturday morning. Full of people with their dogs, children, and scarves, to give you an idea of the clientele. The place is very cute, well decorated and cozy. Definitely a place for a date or for families. It was pretty busy when I came in - most of the seating indoors and outdoors was taken. \n\nObviously they offer donuts and hot dogs. Plenty of options for both, and they have their brioche donuts in the window pane for you to see. They all look very tantalizing, and there's no shortage of appealing options. They also serve coffee and beer. Service was nice and pretty friendly. \n\nI got their pumpkin and nutmeg latte, which was pretty solid. Though pricey at $5. The donut was similarly priced, but really so worth it. I got the Southern Belle donut, which was filled with peach jam. It was damn good from the first bite, and the peach jam works well. It is very dense, and certainly has a lot of sugar, but trust me when I say it's delicious. \n\nI'll definitely come back sometime to try their hot dogs, and definitely try out some different donuts.

Only down side was a wait, but it was a Saturday night before a holiday, no big issue. Second time I tried the Brussels sprouts- amazing and I recommend these to everyone, as well as a flatbread. I also ordered, \"The Ex Boyfriend\" which is a very refreshing martini that has a fruity after taste. I really enjoyed it. I had strawberry tiramisu for dessert and it was a good texture as well as moist but nothing really compares to the original. Lastly, I went for brunch. The seasonal fruit was fresh, the grits were very appetizing as well. I had the stuffed French toast which also had bacon, I enjoyed it. My date had the chunky monkey pancakes that weren't given enough syrup but overall, still well done.","date":1457149030000}

I spent the whole night waiting for the Great Pumpkin when I could have been out for tricks or treats!\n\nSo, too, did I feel today upon receiving my $26 chicken Pho from BT to GO!!!!! ($17 for the Pho, plus delivery, plus tip...).  Before I go into the details, let me assure you of 2 things:  I have had a LOT of Pho all over the world but specifically here in the Tampa Bay.\n\nLet's start with the good: ordering via UberEats was super easy.  From the time I place the order to delivery was around 40 minutes - pretty impressive!   The quantity was large.\n\nOk, now let's get real, folks.  First, upon opening the bag, I was surprised to see that there was no bowl, per se (see photo).  Broth in a high-topped container (chicken in same broth).  Noddle packed into a smaller container- and I mean PACKED to the top.  I could not pour the broth and chicken over the noodles - no room - and adding the noodles to the high-topped container?  First, awkward to eat and second, really - no room.  A fairly thoughtless preparation.  Fortunately, I was at work and found a tupperware bowl in the breakroom...there it is.\n\nOk, now to the Pho.  It was BLAND!  Very few herbs.  2 leaves (yes 2!!!) of basil.  Chicken was tough - way overcooked.  It came with a small, 1 oz container of Hoisin - gratis.  Sriracha was $.55 - really???  I did not get it was the meal was already $$ and I thought I had some at work...alas, I did not...\n\nI  could have paid HALF for better Pho 3 blocks away - and that I shall do in the future.","date":1611351319000}

Get here early (7a-3p Sat)! The line is usually wrapped around the building but moves quickly.

There is indoor and outdoor seating and there are heating lamps for outdoor seating; however, they did not keep the customers warm.  I recommend outdoor seating when the weather is warmer.  \n\nOf course I reviewed all the pictures and most of the reviews on Yelp prior to arrival; therefore, I had an idea what I wanted to order.  The prices are reasonable and the portions were adequate.  I ordered the Eggs Cochon ($13) and had saut\u00e9ed spinach added to it and I also ordered the Bananas Foster Pain Perdu ($11).  Yes, I was being greedy and I could not finish it...but I tried! Lol. \n\nEggs Cochon - the biscuit was very flaky and buttery, the pork was very tender with lots of flavor, the egg was fried to perfection (I don't like poached eggs) land the hollandaise was creamy and cheesy. \n\nBananas Foster - the bread was soft and fresh, there were a lot of raisins but very few bananas; however, the rum sauce was very nice, it was thick with a little cinnamon and nutmeg flavor, yum!.  And it came with two slices of bacon on the side.  The bacon was nice and crispy just like I like it.\n\nI also ordered a mimosa and asked for more champagne that OJ and our waitress informed me it is a double mimosa but she would make it a triple! And at no additional charge! She made a new friend that day...lol. It was great!.  \n\nMy other friend ordered a short stack of buttermilk pancakes (2\/$7) which were golden brown and fluffy. She really enjoyed them.  And the other had the Gulf Fish St. Peter ($15).  The presentation was awesome and the smell was even better.  She killed that plate!

Recess has been on my list for a long time, but I finally made it last weekend. Whereas they used to do the prix fixe menu only, you can now order the components individually and also some other stuff that isn't publicized on their website. Based on portion size, you should expect to either order the prix fixe or your own combo of an appetizer\/entree\/dessert. I had intended to get a cocktail but was sad to see that there were only three on the menu (only two of which were original creations). Our service throughout was attentive if not occasionally awkward. \n\nMy husband and I both started with French onion soup, one of my favorites. Ultimately, I was a little disappointed with this despite its description of \"we don't mess with the classics\". It had a ton of onions, but they were more sauteed than caramelized, and the broth (vegetable-based, I think) was very, very thin. There was a surprising amount of cheese on top, though you don't usually hear me complaining about cheese!\n\nMy husband ordered the prix fixe, so his second course was halibut. This isn't a fish I usually eat so I was excited to try it, but it was really bland. We decided that \"mild\" was the polite way to describe the dish, which also came with a few morel mushrooms and an onion jam. The taste was fine but totally not memorable.\n\nWe also both had a steak course. Mine was unfortunately not that warm...not cold enough to send back, but it had definitely been sitting for awhile. The flavor was good, particularly with the accompanying herb-y sauce, but the meat was a little tough--unacceptable for a dish at this price and really only highlighted by the fact that we were working with butter knives. It had some accompanying mashed potatoes (good) and fresh veggies (mine were mostly carrots with some snap peas, great, but my husband's plate didn't really have carrots).\n\nFor dessert, I had a warm banana bread served with vanilla whipped cream and a delicious carmel-y sauce. I took some bites of my husband's panna cotta, and it was alright.\n\nI think that, for awhile, Recess was edgy. New menu every day, \"fancy\" ingredients, up and coming location, trendy minimalist interior, etc. Five years ago, this restaurant was unique in Indy and was doing things that nowhere else was. Now, that's not really the case. At this price point ($150 for two meals, tax, tip, no alcohol), there are now several better options to be found.","date":1464731433000}

On a fresh bun that I could saw with a knife, it was crumbly and delicious. You pay for quality at Zinburger. My friend ordered a bacon burger with avocado and we split them in half. The bacon was sweet and yummy. Some of the best bacon I've ever had. The avocado fresh and barely stayed on the fork. Mmm. Delicious tomatoes, cheese.. wow! \n\nWe also split a basket of incredibly tasty sweet potato fries and had a Virgil's rootbeer shake each. Real ice cream. The total bill for two burgers, fries and two floats was $40. If you desire a quality burger and quality ingredients without ANY pretentious atmosphere, this is a good place.

The chicken is prepared char sui style and is a deliciously barbecued treat.  My husband had their beef lo mein which, he thought tasted great and the portion size was very filling.  I sampled the Mongolian chicken and their tofu (hot bean curd) dishes along with the vegetable fried rice.  Both dishes were very satisfying.  Both dishes were delivered hot,  fresh,  and well seasoned.  The Mongolian chicken had a lot of onions, but still very good.  I really loved the spicy and savory brown sauce that enveloped the tofu though.  The vegetable fried was yummy and flavorful without being overly salty.

Very diverse menu even though they specialize in baked goods and breads. Make a reservation for the weekend! Our server was very friendly and there was a very diverse crowd with the restaurants between customers and servers very LGBT friendly which was nice to see. The back of the restaurant patio is a nice space for event and just sitting. Their lattes are good sourced from bandit coffee and standard coffee art. The baklava simple was unique as well as the two different kinds of cookies served with each of the latte's. The normal latte came with an apple sesame cookie that was weird at first bite but then was pleasantly delicious. The baklava latte came with a twisted looking cinnamon shortbread cookie that was very good as well. They do a great job with their presentation and baked goods here. The tables are set with glassware and silverware on small plates with a paper place setting when you are seated with a napkin that says their name on it. The lox bagel sandwich is pretty epic! Not the easiest to eat but full of flavor and beautifully presented. The eggs Benedict is served with their biscuit which is more like a bread but absolutely delicious and different than anything I've had before as well as their \"homemade\" bacon which is very thick sliced pork a little bit on the fattier side and topped with a white sauce rather than a Hollandaise sauce. It was a very unique and delicious take on the classic eggs benedict also perfectly paired with a side mixed greens salad perfectly tossed in some sort of light vinaigrette. A bit salty but was a great side to have with the Benedict. I will definitely be back especially for their unique brunch menu!","date":1611434828000}

I was probably going to sooner or later, anyways. So, since I've been there so frequently, and like it enough to give it a four star review, I suppose I should tell you why.\n\nFirst of all, the lettuce, prepared salads, and  wet salads (potato salad, broccoli raisin, whatever they happen to have that day) are all very fresh and delicious. I am definitely partial to the wonton chicken happiness (prepared salad) that they have frequently, as well as the broccoli raisin salad, and will get either of these whenever I see them. One of my favorite things about this place is that the prepared salads and wet salads change frequently, and you will pretty much never see the same line-up of prepared salads or wet salads. I also like that you can check out their web site to see what they will be serving for any particular week, or month, or even day. \n\nI also like being able to build my own salad with my own choice of toppings, and I am proud to say that without Sweet Tomatoes, I might never have tried Jicama, and I am very thankful to them for providing it, since I love trying new foods. \n\nNext up are the soups. Don't discount the soups they have, because they are all very good, and they all rotate around like the prepared salads and wet salads do. They usually have 4 or 5 varieties, and I usually end up trying 2 or 3 of them, depending on the day. I can say that my favorites to date are the Lentil, The Black Bean Chili, and the Potato and Corn one. But I have liked every one I have tried, so there's no going wrong with their soups. They also usually have something delicious cooking up in the carb. department, whether it be 4 cheese formaggio, corn bread, muffins, etc. These, like everything else, rotate frequently and are all very good.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, they usually will have some interesting pasta dishes to try as well. After all of that, you'd think I would be finished, but I am never finished until I get my dessert. And boy, do they have good desserts. Besides the staples of soft serve ice cream, gelatin, fruit, and pudding, they will usually have some kind of delicious bready dessert...cobbler, or lava cake, or cookie bars. Whatever it is, they are almost always a delight. \n\nThey also have a large selection of drinks, which I appreciate, from milk to water to soft drinks. But my favorites are always their juices and teas. I am definitely partial to their strawberry lemonade and their blueberry tea. I also must note that it is a great value, usually less than 20 bucks for the both of us, and my wallet definitely appreciates that. \n\nThe staff is friendly and attentive, quick to remove any plates that you may be finished with, and the place is always clean, bright, and welcoming. \n\nOne final note: I recently ate their for breakfast\/brunch, and was pleasantly surprised. Delicious muffins, dry cereal, biscuits and gravy, waffles, scrambled eggs, fruit, yogurt, breakfast formaggio bread, breakfast potatoes, coffee that I made a horrible mess of, etc. It was a great place to go for a fill-you-up breakfast at a reasonable price. And I think that goes for always, so if you're looking for a place to really fill up without eating a bunch of meat, I think Sweet Tomatoes is the perfect place for you.","date":1304550426000}

Three weeks ago I would have given it 4 stars, but last night I would give it 2. \n\nThree weeks ago, on a Tuesday night around 7:30, we arrived to Bertucci's and it was fairly quiet. We were seated right away and had a great waitress. She was very attentive, making sure our glasses were always full, that we always had bread, and got us our food very quickly. Our entrees were delicious and dessert was amazing, It was a big, gooey chocolate chip cookie that was piping hot and had a scoop of ice cream on it. Our waitress even gave us a bag of rolls to go with out take out boxes, without me even asking her to. I was very pleased and had never had such a good experience at Bertucci's before.\n\nLast night's experience was different. They were busy, but I don't think that should be an excuse. The waitress didn't pay much attention to us after giving us bread. We noticed that the people next to us go their food before us even though they sat down after we ordered ours and then they brought the wrong food over. Food was fine, until we got to dessert. This time there was 3 small cookies instead of one, the cookies were hard and I think old, not very warm. Not at all like what we had earlier in the month.\n\nThere is a reason why we barely visited this restaurant in the past and our visit last night reminded me why.","date":1406320471000}

At our first tasting with Sidney at SBB Gourmet, we immediately felt at home with her and her food blew our minds compared to tastings we had done at Omni and Savoir Faire.  Since I was freaking out about catering costs it took us a couple of months before we actually signed with Sidney, and my husband was the voice of reason- he pointed out that we actually liked and wanted to work with Sidney, and that her food was worth every penny.  (I was feeling a lot of pressure from our contact at Pure Joy Catering and did like their food, but they had a lot of hidden costs that actually made their quote higher than SBB, and we didn't want to work with someone who was going to be pushy and make us feel like we needed to order more, add courses, etc in the process).  We never looked back once we signed our proposal!  There are so many amazing dishes that Sidney and her staff have to offer- it was hard to decide on a menu!  But the most important thing to us was how flexible Sidney was with our needs as a couple.  Since we live in Los Angeles, we didn't want to have any communication issues being further away from the area.  We went back and forth between family style service versus a plated service dinner... We played with the idea of doing a hot appetizer instead of a salad at dinner...  We kept adding and removing dessert items and other extras like coffee, tea, etc.  Sidney did so many different proposals so we could see where we wanted to spend our money, and they were always sent over in a timely manner and with her enthusiasm and kindness boiling over in every email.  We never felt like we were a burden to her.  In the end, Sidney helped us to make decisions that would benefit our vision of our wedding day and not her pocketbook.  She really cares about her clients and goes out of her way to help make your day yours!  \n\nNot to mention, Sidney's assistant Jessica is out of this world amazing with all of the logistics.  She attended our site visit and took care of all of our rentals. She told us exactly what we would need for our outdoor venue (we had to bring everything in- tables, chairs, the kitchen, everything), how much alcohol to buy, and even helped us with ideas for the layout of our dining and ceremony areas.  At the wedding, the service was fantastic!  My friend who has worked as a Catering Manager for high-end hotels for the past 10 years was wow'd by the dinner service, and she is tough to impress!  The bartenders were awesome and were quick at pouring drinks and creating concoctions to please the guests who didn't want the signature cocktails.  The only thing that we heard about after the wedding was that they forgot to stock the bar with our champagne at the start of cocktail hour, but the staff quickly fixed this.  I had champagne in my hand a few minutes later so I had no idea it even happened until someone told me about it. \n\nAt the end of the day, I can't imagine our wedding day without SBB Gourmet.  There were so many beautiful touches- the presentation of the food, the service, the little decor details that added that special personal touch.  Our wedding felt like it represented \"us\" as a couple, and SBB Gourmet helped to add character rather than feeling like a vendor providing food.  Our guests STILL rave about how good the food was!  The churros were the best EVER and went so quickly at the wedding.  And man we wish we could have taken home 10 plates of everything so we could have had more of it after the day was over!\n\nOur Final Menu, if you're interested:\n\nPassed Appetizers:\nbeer battered quail with cider adobo dipping sauce (!)\nmaple glazed pork belly on a mini corn cake\npistachio crusted goat cheese with a honey pipette\n\nPlated Amuse Bouche:\nthree cheese ravioli with sweet corn and oregano cream sauce (to die for!!!)\n\nPlated Entrees\/Sides:\npan seared chicken breast with crispy herb rubbed skin & lemon cream\nbraised beef short ribs with bordeaux demi reduction sauce\nstuffed portobello mushroom with quinoa, faro, & asparagus with parsley pesto\nceleriac mashed potatoes\noven roasted root vegetables\n\nDessert:\ngourmet churros with chocolate dipping sauce & cinnamon creme anglaise dipping sauce\n\n\nIf you are looking for a caterer for your wedding or any event in the Santa Barbara area, look no further than SBB Gourmet.

I decided to go with the mushroom, Swiss, avocado turkey burger sans bun with some fries. It came out along fairly quickly and was so good. Sometimes turkey burgers can be dry but this was one wasn't and had a great flavor too it. The portion of fries wasn't too large and they were seasoned just right. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food. Some of them got burgers, while one tried a club sandwich and the soup of the day. We also seemed to come on the right day because it was free cookie Wednesday. Imagine this girls delight! We each got to choose either two chocolate chip, double chocolate chip, or white chocolate macadamia nut. I opted for the classic chocolate chip and they were slightly warm and soft in the middle.

The food here is very reliable....although not spectacular.  I recently enjoyed a maafe lamb and rice dish here.  The peanut sauce was excellent ... and made even better when I requested hot sauce.  The lamb in the Maafe, however was not of the best quality in my opinion - a little too much fat and bone at the same time.

If there word of mouth is that good then it is definitely worth trying and it totally met it's high expectations. The food was great. Now keep in mind that this is not your typical Apple-bees, Outback, or any other major chain, this is a good old fashion mom and pop BBQ joint. The meat was delicious!!! I had the 1\/2 and 1\/2 sandwich which is a poled pork and tri-tip sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. I also got a side of the butternut squash which was amazing! I'd go back just for that if nothing else. I went with a group of 5 adults and 2 kids and our total bill was $56! My son had the grilled PB&J which was pretty darn good. The bread was thick and sweet and grilled perfectly. Believe it or not, it is a must have. All in all everyone was very happy with there meals and no complainants which I kind of expected some complaints as the side dishes are all vegan and the group I was with was certainly not a vegan loving group of people. The restaurant it's self was nothing impressive as it is an old, really old, lounge that this rented out by MFT. Try not to judge them on that as this is obviously a stepping stone location for this new start up eatery. Lastly I was utterly impressed with the fact that all there meals had a gluten free or vegan option. It is rare to have a place that serves BBQ to also focus on ditetary concerns such as that. Great Job MFT!!!!!","date":1402935004000}

Probably the best I've had in Wilmington. I usually get a few rolls and have not been disappointed yet!

They were bland and easily something I could make at home for 1\/2 the price. Both times I've been there my food was served cold. Cold chili or pasta is not appetizing. The only good part was that the service was prompt. I won't go again unless they change their menu to include better, tastier vegan options.","date":1320326388000}
